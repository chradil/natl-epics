				"description": "My chapter will bear out George Brandes’ claim, made in his 1903 “study of the land, people, and literature” of Poland, that in Adam Mickiewicz’s 1834 poem Pan Tadeusz “Poland possesses the only successful epic [the nineteenth] century has produced.” I first outline briefly the epic tradition in Polish literature, from Piotr Kochanowski’s 1618 translation of Tasso’s Gerusalemme Liberata to (the miscarried) efforts to produce a national epic according to classicist specifications. I then situate Pan Tadeusz within the tradition of Western foundational epics, epitomized by Vergil’s Aeneid, on the one hand; and the romantic horizon of expectations (as articulated above all by the Polish critic Maurycy Mochnacki) of what might constitute a national epic, on the other, with a view toward the Herderian—modern—concept of nation. As such, Pan Tadeusz constitutes a “social drama” (Victor Turner) that enacts the passage of an effete premodern society on the verge of extinction to a revitalized, nationally conscious collective. I conclude by arguing that the poem’s status as Poland’s national epic is as much a function of its reception by the immediate, post-romantic generation as it is by Mickiewicz’s epic intentions."

				"description": "'I could construct seven different Kalevalas from the poems I have collected so far', wrote the physician Elias Lönnrot (1802–1884) in 1848. While revolutions convulsed most of Europe, the Finnish intelligentsia concentrated on forging a collective identity from the former easternmost provinces of the Swedish kingdom. Publication of the Kalevala was key to this nation-building. This book of Finnish-language folk poems was from its first edition (1835; extended version 1849) honored as 'the national epic of the Finns'; one of the poorest, most scarcely-populated corners of North-Eastern Europe thus provided one of the most succesful national epics in the Europe of romantic nationalism. However, the Kalevalaic storyworld's decisive cultural breakthrough came only in the late nineteenth century, as the language of culture and learning, politics and economics changed from Swedish to Finnish. The 50 poems and almost 23000 verses of the Kalevala are set in the pagan past, and its narrative arches from an archaic creation myth to the arrival of Christianity. The Kalevala has inspired a wide variety of painters, architects, musicians and writers in Finland. Restaurants, insurance companies, banks, newspapers, icebreakers, items of jewellery, matchboxes and crispbread brands all carry names of Kalevalaic heroes. Generations of school kids have struggled with its trochaic metre and illustrated its poems in their art classes, although cother national narratives are now usurping its canonical role in school curricula. The book has been translated into more than 60 languages, inspiring, for example, H.W. Longfellow and J. R. R. Tolkien. Lately, ultra-nationalistic right-wing ”pseudohistories” have capitalized on its images of archaic Finnishness. So although the average Finn reads Lönnrot' s text less than ever, it it continues to permeate Finnish national culture of the 21st century."

				"description": "The turbulent first hundred years of the Greek State (1828-1923) were formative in developing a modern national identity. Major political and social upheavals led to extensive changes in the intellectual life of the young country. The Homeric epics formed part of the education of the Greek-speaking elite throughout the Byzantine empire, but the two long poems (very different in character and poetic style) never became national epics. Only after the formation of the Modern Greek state did the Homeric texts assume some national epic characteristics-- but they were read in translation, since their archaic poetic diction was incomprehensible for most readers. The discovery of vernacular redactions of the Byzantine Tale of Digenis Akritis in the later nineteenth century, and of associated folk-songs with Digenis as hero, suggested that this material belongs to an epic that could be called national. My chapter will examine various aspects of the presence of Homer and of the Digenis Akritis in Greece. Translations and popularizations of the ancient epics gained political charge around the turn of the 20th century, and the travails of Odysseus in the Odyssey served as a metaphor for the fate of Greek people over centuries as exiles and immigrants. Various adaptations of the Digenis were made for the stage in heroic or even comic guises. This chapter will include input from high-school students from Thessalonica who have been been taught Homer and the Digenis at school-- which leads us to question whether any text currently serves as “national epic” or even “anti-epic” as the country struggles to recover from the financial crisis of 2009 and the pandemic."

				"description": "On April 21st, 1971, a large crowd of people gathered at the harbor in Reykjavík, Iceland. It was a cold day, yet the atmosphere was festive; people were dressed in their finest, children were lined up at the quay and fluttering flags were in abundance. The cause for celebration was the arrival of a coast guard ship from Denmark, bringing as its unusual cargo two medieval manuscripts to be delivered to the Icelandic nation as one of the earliest and unparalleled gestures of cultural offering and repatriation. The event marks in many ways the apex of a process of cultural identity-formation in Iceland; a consolidation of the past into a single symbolic narrative mediated in the textual manifestation of that past, that is the Íslendingasögur (the sagas of Icelanders) and the eddic poems. This chapter will elaborate on the process of self-realization and actualization of a national identity via literary history, more specifically through the cultural history provided by the sagas as a memorial to settlement, community-building, and cultural inheritance. It will discuss the role of the mythographical poems and the sagas as national epics and their role within literary history more broadly. Finally, it will contend with the vexed issue of national identity and belonging being affirmed through lineage and heritage and the frequently problematic appropriation and reformulation of literary history for such purposes."

				"description": "The classic Korean novel The Story of Hong Gildong narrates the adventures of the title character, an illegitimate son of a nobleman who leaves home to become the intrepid leader of outlaws who steal from the wealthy and punish the corrupt, and then leaves the country with his followers to become the ruler of his own island kingdom.  In modern Korea, it has become the best-known epic from traditional literature, often used to speak of the ingenuity, resilience, and dynamism of the Korean people.  Unfortunately, much of the scholarly understanding of the work itself has been marred by a series of historical myths concerning its production, in particular that it was written by an aristocratic writer in the early seventeenth century, inspired by the great Chinese bandit epic Water Margin.  In actuality, it appears to have been composed in the middle or late nineteenth century, when Joseon dynasty Korea was undergoing tremendous change and decline due to the pressures of modernity and foreign intervention.  There is evidence to show that The Story of Hong Gildong was a popular work at the time of its publication, but its rise as a kind of national epic did not occur until the modern era, through countless retellings in film, television, novels, and comic books.  In that sense, the Hong Gildong story that most Koreans are familiar with is largely a modern reinvention of the classic character, oftentimes serving specific political and cultural functions of the contemporary period.  This chapter examines the transformation of the figure from classic literature to its iconic status in the modern Korean imagination."

				"description": "Saxo’s History of the Danes (Gesta Danorum), finished around 1208, has all the credentials of a national epic: it is of venerable age, it is long (c. 750 pp), it makes grand claims for a small nation, it is written in artful prose and even includes extensive poems, it is heroic, it covers an impressive timespan. But for the romantic intellectuals it came with one fatal flaw: it was written in Latin. The book therefore never got even close to the status of the otherwise comparable Heimskringla in Norway or Nibelungen in Germany. In my chapter I will focus on the prolific romanticist decades c. 1800-1830 in which the new desire for a national epic text circled in frustration around Gesta Danorum and other texts – incl. Beowulf with its Danish setting. The main protagonist of my piece is the leading figure of N.F.S. Grundtvig (1783-1872), translator, author, national mobilizer, churchman and more, seconded by the popular author B.S. Ingemann (1789-1862) and scholars such as C. Molbech (1783-1857) and P.E. Müller (1776-1834). Their romantic aspirations for revitalizing the heritage of pagan or medieval Danish culture were sharpened by the national disasters following in the wake of Denmark’s siding with Napoleon: a national bankruptcy was declared in 1813, and the following year the monarchy lost Norway. The search for an epic produced much excellent literature and scholarship, but ultimately failed. Since then the Danish canon developed along multiple lines, but would never count a medieval classic as part of it. Perhaps new translations as well as global Latin and global English is about to get Saxo more readers than ever before."

				"description": "On the face of it, the story of William Tell, who retaliates for being forced to shoot an apple from his son’s head by assassinating the Habsburg governor, epitomises the desire of the Swiss for liberation from foreign oppressors. As with all national stories, however, Tell can mean different things to different constituencies. This chapter will initially survey the genesis of the story in the late fifteenth century at the time of Swiss independence from the Habsburgs, together with its early development in drama, lyric and chronicle, in particular, Aegidius Tschudi’s Chronicon Helveticum. It will then examine its successive appropriations, first by the French Revolution, and second by Schiller, whose play Wilhelm Tell (1804) promulgates romantic ideals of individual freedom and liberation distinct from self-interested political violence. By the mid-nineteenth century, in tune with their constitutionalisation, the Swiss seem to have decided to accept this German play as a mirror of their national identity, troping Schiller \"the German poet with the Swiss heart.\" The play continued in annual production throughout the twentieth century, ideologically divided between largescale, lay productions valorising a conservative vision of the nation, and art-house productions critiquing the potentially right-wing implications of its patriotism. Further important post-war responses include Max Frisch’s Wilhelm Tell für die Schule (1971), and the 2014 film, Schweizer helden, in which Schiller’s play is performed by asylum seekers.  However, some of the most thought-provoking revisions of Tell in the modern age are not textual but iconographic. Finally, this chapter will explore the images of Tell created by Richard Kissling (1895), and Ferdinand Hödler (1897), and their re-animation in twentieth-century Swiss political posters to support positions from the extreme left to the extreme right, along with the series of psychoanalytic William Tell paintings produced by Salvador Dali in the 1930s."

				"description": "The nation now known as Romania has a long and complex history. Indigenous peoples yield to Greek and Roman colonization, with Mongol and later Ottoman incursions resisted by Moldavian, Transylvanian, and Wallachian principalities. Architects of a cohesive Romanian identity drew from rich but multifarious materials in shaping novels and then state-sponsored films. National emergence is figured as an epic journey; Romania and the Republic of Moldova make different selections from overlapping sources. Maintenance of a nation-wide culture, as opposed to regional or ethnic self-identification, was a pressing concern for the Bucharest elites well into the 20th century. Novels, and later state-sponsored films, realized Romanian ethno-genesis through victories of ethnic Romanians on the battlefields of medieval Wallachia and Moldovia, or, reaching further back, Rome's conquest of Dacia . Films of this kind feature iconic Dacian kings or medieval princes as heroes of the nation, not as heroic individuals. From the later 19th century onwards, epic metaphors of Romanian self-definition ascribe ominous agency to the East (traditionally, to the Ottoman and the Russian Empires). Romania, from the backwaters of Eastern Europe, thus strives to align itself with the West, developing the grand narrative of a relatively new nation that prides itself on speaking one of the five major Romance languages-- uniquely, in Eastern Europe. Mihail Sadoveanu (1880-1961) and Nicolae Dabija (1948-2021) argued for the rights of Romanian nationals in contested borderlands, using the perceived clout of their native tongue (as a nation-building tool) and fictionalizing history. Sadoveanu, author of historically-themed novels adapted to the big screen, became a household name for Romanian-speaking audiences. Dabija, as a nationally-minded Romanian writer of the Republic of Moldova, shows how national identity might be actualized through Romanian literary culture in the post-Soviet republic."

				"description": "What is your national epic? Both terms are a challenge for Australia, a settler nation with origins in the history of British colonialism. Here and now, the thing that characterizes Australia as a nation is unresolved sovereignty, a latent sentiment that is growing fast and deeply felt. The sovereignty of white Australia is mainstream and dominant—including the English language enshrined in foundational documents like the Constitution—but also unstable, incomplete, and illegitimate for an increasing number of Australians. First nation Australians are asserting their claims to a sovereignty that was never ceded. ‘Always was, always will be Aboriginal land’ is a powerful dictum in public discourse. These shifts must inflect the idea of national epic. As elsewhere, the reality of the Australian nation is in process rather than resolved. There is no single Australian national epic. Candidates include Marcus Clarke’s convict novel For the Term of His Natural Life (1870-1872, 1874), Eleanor Dark’s trilogy of national settlement The Timeless Land (1941), James McAuley’s sectarian poem of maritime discovery Captain Quiros (1964) and Patrick White’s The Tree of Man (1955).  We will focus primarily on novels that, in containing history and envisioning nation, can be counted as epics. Henry Handel Richardson’s trilogy, The Fortunes of Richard Mahony (1930) and Alexis Wright’s Carpentaria (2006) trace an arc along which time, nation and history refract through life-stories of individually conceived but representative characters. These novels share formal aspects germane to the epical work of nation: each reworks the European and modern novel. Richardson reworks the structural achievements of the realist novel to historicize a nation through the tragic life of her protagonist while Wright reconceptualizes the magical realist novel’s form and language to write Aboriginal deep time."

				"description": "The island of Martinique (Martinican Matinik or Matnik) lies directly north of St Lucia and (further south) Trinidad. As a départemente of France, it is a special territory of the European union, and its currency is the euro. Almost everyone on the island speaks French and Martinican creole; the speaking of Kalinago, an Arawakan language, faded in the early twentieth century under intense colonialist pressure. Three of the most influential anti-colonialist writers of the region (or of any region) emerged from Martinique: Aimé Césaire (1913-2008), Franz Fanon (1925-1961), and Édouard Glissant (1928-2011). Texts such as Aimé Césaire's Cahier d'un retour au pays natal, (1939) and Fanon's The Wretched of the Earth (1961), and also the work of Glissant, contribute to and draw from the movement of négritude, which was also shaped and documented by women writers. Jeanne Nardal (1900-1993) and Paulette Nardal (1896-1985), theorized the movement and laid important connections with the Harlem Renaissance; Suzanne Césaire edited Tropiques, the most influential Francophone Caribbean journal. Édouard Glissant was shortlisted for the Noble Prize in 1992, when it was awarded an epical poet from the island fifty miles to the south: Derek Walcott (see 'St Lucia' chapter). Many major writers from Martinique were drawn to contemplation of wide, epical spaces: Glissant developed a notion of Antillanité, evoking a space stretching to Latin America, whereas Aimé Césaire emphasized African cathections. Landscapes of Martinican space remain of vital concern today, as writers ponder relations between poetry and ecology in light of what is now a distinguished, and highly influential, literary tradition."
