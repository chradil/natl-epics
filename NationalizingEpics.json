				"description": "Medieval Arab scholars had much to say about ‘Mali’, a rich West African kingdom. Some report that Mali’s ruler gains authority by being descended lauded from Sunjata. Nowadays Sunjata still features in West African oral traditions and standardized praise songs; Jata means ‘lion’, and the fascination for this animal has been key to Sunjata’s wide appeal over the centuries. Literary scholars have assessed the oral traditions featuring Sunjata as ‘epic’, and historians have unveiled historical aspects of these traditions, ranging from iron age practices to processes of state formation in modern times. However, the Sunjata epic draws its great present-day fame, and it claims to be counted among ‘national epics,’ from early 20th-century scholarship that attributed to medieval Mali the status of ‘empire,’ and that ‘humanized’ Sunjata as a 13th-century, historical founder of the dynasty of Mali’s rulers. This ‘history’ (not meeting present-day research standards) was taught as complementary to an (equally biased) linear history of France – narrated in terms of empires and nations – to West African schoolteachers. This account became commonly accepted among the political elites of the independence era, and so medieval Mali (and Sunjata) became historical sources of inspiration for French colonies seeking independence. This is best illustrated by Soudan Français becoming ‘République du Mali’ in 1960. This image of the historical person Sunjata as founder of the Mali empire has since been further rooted in society by classroom teaching, theatre plays, popular music, movies, novels, and other media. An important recent development is the growing public tendency to view Sunjata’s foundation of society as a charter representing Africa’s contribution to the Declaration of Universal Human Rights, thus transcending intellectually Western biases in Human Rights thinking and thus empowering West Africa’s role in global history."

				"description": "From the earliest epic of Chile’s history, The Araucaniad (1569-1589) by Alonso de Ercilla, to contemporary epic graffiti murals depicting Chile’s history, like Danny Reveco’s Without Land, without Water, without Sky (2017), a common thread running through Chile’s epic tradition has been the incorporation, negation, elimination, heroization, infantilization, eulogization, resistance, and persistence of the Indigenous nations living within the borders of what has become Chilean national territory. As a result, these Chilean epics have had to confront the violence and spoliation attending the nation’s foundation. This epic thread begins with colonial-era representations of the conquest like Ercilla’s The Araucaniad (1569, 1578, 1589) and Pedro de Oña’s Arauco Tamed (1596) that face the problem of how to represent Indigenous nations and Spanish colonial military commanders during the conquest as well as Chile’s peripheral position within the Spanish empire. Later, in the century and a half following the formation of the Chilean nation-state in the early 19th century, authors like Alberto Blest Gana and Gabriela Mistral were frequently concerned with the consolidation of the Chilean nation, a task requiring the imagined incorporation or erasure of Indigenous nations within a singular Chilean nationality as well as a reckoning with that imagined Chilean nationality’s dependence on and peripheral relationship to European cultural, political, and economic dominance. Lastly, in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, authors and artists like Nona Fernández and Danny Reveco presented renewed focus on the spoliation and violence waged against Indigenous nations throughout Chilean history, thereby giving way to a new vision of plurinationality constituted by a multiplicity of autonomous nations and communities. In sum, the epic tradition in Chile has had to confront the (proto-/pluri-) nation’s incorporation or negation of Indigenous nations, its history of violence, and its peripheral condition."

				"description": "Key terms at stake in this volume, ‘nation’ and ‘epic,’ are especially productive and problematic for South Africa. Is South Africa a nation? Can there be any sort of foundational epic in a multilingual settler colony—a colony, moreover, whose history can be seen as one of competing nationalisms?  And what is an epic?  Should emphasis lie on the oral or the narrative implications of the term?  This contribution will examine Shaka ka Senzangakhona’s praise song (izibongo) as the most obvious example of the genre. It is, after all, a work performed orally, concerns a warrior-hero, and does have a pedagogical function, as all national projects have, in fostering loyalty to the recently centralized monarchy.  It is, moreover, part of a broader tradition that is central to South African literature, shaping, as it did, the forms and rhetoric of much anti-apartheid poetry and drama. But the ways in which this epic may differ from others included here are also fascinating.  It is marked by repetition and recurrence, possible emerging from a cyclical conception of time, rather than a progressive narrative. The second person address also differentiates it, as does its obvious relationship to personal izibongo of ordinary subjects. Furthermore, to single out a Zulu text is problematic, especially in light of the violent transition to democracy and the catastrophic Zuma presidency, where dangers of an ethnic, regional, antimodernist militarism became obvious. We will therefore also consider a few important critical interventions, e.g. J.M. Coetzee on the impossibility of a ‘Great South African Novel,’ as well as some more vulnerable, tentative, contemporary epic endeavors, including Jeremy Cronin’s poetic ‘Venture into the Interior’ (written in prison in 1987), and Jolyn Phillip’s feminist ‘kontra-epos’ Bientang (2021), a retooling of Afrikaans to trace the forgotten history of the last Khoi beach nomad (strandloper), her imagined ancestor."

				"description": "‘Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.’ Thus famously begins Gabriel García Márquez’s classic novel One Hundred Years of Solitude (1967), whose main character Colonel Buendía has become an epic literary hero. Seeking to alter the course of history in his home country (a fictional nation easily recognizable as Colombia), Colonel Buendía left the distant village of Macondo, revolted against the government, organized thirty-two armed uprisings, and lost them all. Feared by many politicians and having escaped many attempts on his life, he was celebrated, despite his numerous defeats, as a national treasure. Yet by the time he died only a street named after him was left to remember his heroic actions. Colonel Buendía is the archetype of the Colombian and by extension Latin American fighter, for whom failure becomes more epic than victory itself. Colombia has seen many revolutions arise and be crushed since it gained its independence from Spain in 1819, and thus, the country has remained under the control of old ruling elites for more than a century of solitude. Yet one of the most powerful narratives that this country has produced is one of rebellion and hope in a final victory of the insurgents—a victory that has yet to happen. Colonel Buendía’s story and Colombian history feed each other in an epic of revolutionary failure. Over the decades, Colonel Buendía has become a character who has escaped the written page and inspired the actions of guerrilla fighters in and beyond Colombia. In the process, One Hundred Years of Solitude has become a national epic and furthermore a regional epic – a true fictional story about the fate of Colombia, Latin America, and its peoples."

				"description": "Epic poems written in Mexico during the sixteenth and seventeen centuries are curious artifacts that sing their praises to the Spanish colonial enterprise while being living testimony to the shortcomings of European hegemony in the Americas. Focusing either on the misdeeds of Spaniards disguised as heroism or on the abandonment and disenfranchisement that conquistadors purport to live through, the alleged celebration of a not-so-distant glorious past takes second place to the reality of violence and precarity that surfaces from this kind of literature. Moreover, the textual misfortunes of many of these poems bear witness to a history of oblivion and neglect from early and modern readers and scholars. With few exceptions, Mexican epic poetry remains an obscure corpus of texts with scant presence in the university curriculum and little to no relevance in the country’s modern imaginary. This chapter aims to answer the following questions: Is there a thing as a ‘Mexican epic’? And, if so, where should we find it? What material conditions allowed the production of these poems, and what sense do they make today? Some of the poems that I’ll study are: Francisco de Terraza’s Nuevo mundo y conquista; Gabriel Lobo Lasso de la Vega’s Cortés valeroso and Mexicana (1594); Antonio Saavedra y Guzmán’s El peregrino indiano (1599); Gaspar Pérez de Villagra’s Historia de la Nueva México (1610); Bernardo de Balbuena’s El Bernardo (1624) and Grandeza mexicana (1604); and Arias de Villalobo’s Canto intitulado Mercurio (1623)."

				"description": "This contribution will analyze and offer insights into the epic imaginings of land, love and (con)quest as found in selections from and resonant between two works -- one by 18th century Sufi poet Waris Shah and the other by early 20th century political philosopher Muhammad Iqbal. The love story Heer Ranja by the Panjabi Sufi poet Waris Shah is often identified by Indo-Pakistani critics as an epic (with lyrical and mystical overtones), given its plot of favored son, family conflicts and lost love. The story is mapped over the territorial lands of the Panjab and invokes tropes of love, loss and wandering, and romantic union thwarted. Especially popular in Pakistan, it has been made into several films. Heer Ranja aligns with a long, rich tradition of mainly Punjabi Indian girl-meets-boy stories and folktales (e.g., Sohni Mahiwal), while yet resonating with the famous boy-meets-girl Arab story of Majnun Layla. As an epic-lyrical narrative, it has been cultivated, appropriated, and absorbed into other genres and cultural modes, including film. The second work, by nationalist poet-philosopher Muhammad Iqbal, consists of a children's poem ‘Parinde ki Faryad’ (‘Bird's Lament’) in his Urdu Bang-e-Dara (Call of the Marching Bell). This short poem speaks to the devastating impact of colonialism, imperialism and industrialism upon Indo-Muslim societies at the turn of the century, evoking a profound sadness, with its portrayal of conquest and loss of homeland (‘want’), vistas and gardens. Moreover, in framing it as children’s literature, with the lament expressed through the voice of an animal (a bird), Iqbal establishes ongoing generational parallels between loss of cultural identities and loss of ecological habitat(s). He hence presciently draws attention to issues of wildlife preservation and planetary survival within the context of emergent forms of consciousness-- at individual, communal, national, and transnational levels."

				"description": "The Mahāvaṃsa (or ‘Great Chronicle,’ as it is sometimes called) is a Pali text—part historiography, part literature—whose beginnings can be traced to the Buddhist Mahāvihāra monastic fraternity in 6th century CE Sri Lanka. In charting the pious undertakings of Sinhala kings and their relationships of patronage with different monastic orders in support of the Buddhist religion (buddhasāsana), the Mahāvaṃsa has long been treated as a template for the proper relationship between Buddhism and the Sri Lankan state. However, the island’s location at the crossroads of Indian Ocean trade, pilgrimage, and diplomatic networks militates against the notion of Sri Lanka—despite the best efforts of monastic chroniclers and nationalist historians alike—as a monolithically Buddhist nation. Indeed, the status of the Mahāvaṃsa as a ‘national epic’ is a vexed question in Sri Lanka because of the ways in which Sinhala-Buddhist nationalists have used the text to articulate a religiously inflected and ethnically exclusivist vision of the post-colonial state, one in which Tamil and Muslim minorities are subjugated. This chapter proposes to read the Mahāvaṃsa for glimpses of the political that challenge nationalist appropriations of the text that would see it as serving primarily a legitimating function—that is, as sanctifying the island as a privileged space in which the Buddhist religion is destined to flourish. We might instead consider how the Mahāvaṃsa represents kings whose courts were socially, politically, and religiously complex, and how negotiation of that complexity figured centrally in the making of ‘good’ Buddhist kings. Along the way, I intend to juxtapose these readings of the Mahāvaṃsa with rituals of the modern Sri Lanka state that invoke locales and personages from the Mahāvaṃsa in new articulations of Sinhala-Buddhist nationalism that emerged following the Sri Lanka state’s military defeat of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 2009.

				"description": "Is it possible to conceive of a national epic before the nation as such exists? – and what might that epic look like?  Those are the questions Torquato Tasso put to himself as he spent his life writing, re-writing, and then revising yet again his Gerusalemme liberata, attempting to define for himself and his readers a language, a culture, and a poem that might just be called ‘Italian.’  Almost three centuries later, when the country was finally on the threshold of nationhood, Alessandro Manzoni posed the same questions, coming up with an equally tortured result with his Promessi Sposi, likewise subject to extensive rewriting after its initial publication.  And yet like Tasso’s work, it too could only gesture toward something called Italy, if in radically different ways from Tasso’s wishfully pan-European poem. What then might be the ‘real’ Italian epic – a work that comes to terms with the fallout from the long and rocky narrative towards something called independence from foreign powers?  The second part of this essay will put forward two alternatives to our tendency to think big about epic, in terms of both its supposed confidence and its sprawl. They are two texts that show an Italy more fractured than united. From the north, Carlo Collodi’s dystopic vision of humans, animals, and the world in between in his Pinocchio; and from the south, Tomasi de Lampedusa’s Il Gattopardo, which looks back to those heady days of the Risorgimento from Lampedusa’s Sicilian perch in the decade after World War II."

				"description": "In the summer of 2019, the Spanish Biblioteca Nacional in Madrid carefully pulled the fragile codex of Poema del Mio Cid (PMC) from its climatized vault and for the first time placed it in a glass box that would allow the public to gaze upon the manuscript during a period of fifteen days. Those who filed past the work—almost as if it were the bodily relics of Spain's patron saint Santiago--may have been disappointed.  It is an ugly, sloppy little manuscript, a 14th century copy of a lost original, missing folia and bearing the stains of reckless scholarly attempts to decipher it using reagents.  It has none of the apocalyptic splendor of the highly illuminated Beatus manuscripts or the extraordinarily opulent, meticulous organized and monumentally illustrated Codice Rico bearing Alfonso X's Cantigas de Santa Maria.  Yet the primary function of the PMC manuscript—its humble appearance notwithstanding--is not to astound Spaniards with an anticipated spectacle of the medieval, but rather to provide the Spanish national imaginary with indisputable evidence of an epic work written in Castilian that according to recent scholars, ‘stands side by side with Homeric poems, the Anglo-Saxon Beowulf, the Old French Chanson de Roland, Milton’s Paradise Lost, and other such contributions from the epic genre to the Weltliteratur pantheon’ (Zaderenko and Montaner). My chapter charts the rise of the PMC, noting the way modern scholars and politicians rediscovered and embraced the work followed by its extensive dissemination in popular media. Unwittingly and often against the work's content, the PMC conveys some of the most entrenched tenets of (largely right-wing) Spanish nationalism: Spain as a Christian nation in opposition to Islam, the myth of the medieval Christian ‘Reconquest,’ belief in the continuity of a perceived national character, reassurance about Castile's centrality, and Castellano's legitimacy as the national language of Spain."

				"description": "Sepha rueang Khun Chang Khun Phaen (KCKP) is a love triangle that ends with the death of the heroine, Wanthong. Developed orally over several centuries with contributions from many people, it was designed for performance by stylised recitation. No concrete evidence suggests when the telling of KCKP started. Prince Damrong Rajanubhab, editor of the standard edition, notes that it is a true story that took place in the Ayutthaya era (1351–1767) and dated it around 1500. The translators of the first complete translation, Baker and Pasuk, surmise that the tale emerged around 1600, based on hints found in the poem and political circumstances in Ayutthaya. The story was passed down orally as a folktale and later written down as a poetic text for sepha (เสภา) performance. Possibly as early as the 18th century, the court started adopting KCKP, and interest grew remarkably in the early Bangkok period (1782–present). Sepha scripts in the Ayutthaya era that survived down to the Bangkok era depended upon what people could remember, and just a few texts; as a result, almost everything had to be recreated in Bangkok. The construction of KCKP as a national literary work was largely influenced by Siamese court values. In 1917-1918, the standard edition was printed by the Wachirayan Library. This has become the authoritative version of the work, reproduced countless times for use in schools and for general public consumption. It has been read and adapted into prose versions, novels, plays, films, TV series and comic books. Thai society continues to interpret and reinterpret KCKP, and 2021 witnessed an attempt to introduce a subversive female voice into this epic. The most recent adaptation into a TV series foregrounded the female protagonist by naming the show 'Wanthong', rather than 'Khun Chang Khun Phaen', the two male protagonists."

				"description": "In 1836 literary critic José Antonio Echeverría discovered in the library of Havana’s ‘Sociedad de Amigos del País’ a copy of Espejo de paciencia, an epic poem written by Silvestre de Balboa in 1608. This first known work of Cuban literature narrates the kidnapping and freeing of the Bishop of Cuba, Juan de las Cabezas Altamirano, by French pirates in 1604. For years the way this poem first appeared, and the subsequent loss of the original manuscript, have raised doubts about its authenticity. The fact that Echeverría was prominent in the literary circle of Domingo del Monte, who released Espejo de paciencia, raised fears of forgery. The aesthetic ideals of this group did indeed determine it to search for mythical origins for Cuban literature, similar to El Cid in Spain. Espejo de paciencia is the first literary representation of an African slave in Cuban literature. The final scene sees the African slave Salvador Golomón kill the leader of the French pirates, and for this reason Silvestre de Balboa asks in the poem for the emancipation of the slave. Doubts dog this episode because it is too close to the abolitionist ideas of Echeverría and his friends. These scenes have created controversy, a politics of mistrust. But behind the controversies of literary scholars lie more important issues, such as the legacy of slavery and racism in Cuba. Fragments of this poem were published in Cuba, Spain, and United States in the 19th century. Complete editions were published in Cuba in 1927, 1928, 1929, 1942, 1960, and 1962; and abroad in 1970 (US), 1981, 2009, and 2010 (Spain). Now a fixture of the Cuban literary canon, the poem is read in schools and universities and has prompted works by writers Francisco Calcagno, José Lezama Lima, Cintio Vitier, Alejo Carpentier, and Antonio Benítez Rojo."

				"description": "Symbols and narratives of Slovak nationalism developed mostly in the 19th-century with Romantic nationalist revivalism, responding primarily to the extant symbolism of other nations. Some such nations inspired emulation in Slovakian nationalists, others a desire for counter-distinction. As a small nation whose territory had formed part of the Kingdom of Hungary since the 11th century, Slovakia clung to myths of a glorious past in the pre-Hungarian era. The history of Great Moravia and its prominent figures, such as Duke Svätopluk and Saints Cyril and Methodius, ‘Apostles to the Slavs,’ were thus celebrated in the Classicising heroic epics by poet Ján Hollý; Romantics later added motifs of victimhood and Realists of outsiderism. National self-representation repeatedly posits a small, ethnically and socially oppressed nation, hardworking Slovaks trapped for a millennium within the Kingdom of Hungary, vividly symbolised by outlaw Juraj Jánošík. This son of poor Slovak peasants, who ‘took from the rich, gave to the poor,’ was executed while still young by hanging from a hook. National legendary tradition depicts him as the victim of foreign or denationalised nobility; Romantics add suggestions of a messianic sacrifice, offered on behalf of the nation (as in Ján Botto's lyrical-epic poem Smrť Jánošíkova, Jánošík´s Death. In the 20th and 21st centuries, Great-Moravian legends and tales of Jánošík became part not only of modern Slovak statehood, but also of ideological scheming and new political clashes. References to Great Moravia and the Cyril-Methodius tradition have been much revived as state symbols and national myths since 1989. We will highlight important moments of instrumentalizing such motifs (Great Moravia's glorious past, Jánošík as folk-national martyr) both in artistic creation and political discourse in Slovakia from the 19th century until the present moment."

				"description": "The year 1874 marked a turning point for what Armenians would come to consider their national epic. The erudite cleric (later bishop), ethnographer, historian, and political activist Garegin Sruandzteants‘ published in Constantinople (now Istanbul) David of Sasun or the Gate of Mher. It was based on the oral recitation by Krpo from the village of Aṙnist (near the town of Mush in present-day Turkey). Sruadzteants‘ feared that the down-to-earth folk tale with its ‘crude’ dialect would be harshly criticized, but the publication received overwhelmingly positive reactions from prominent Armenian intellectuals and public figures around the world. This led to further ethnographic research and recordings of new versions, and between then and now more than 150 variants have been written down or (later) recorded. This chapter will explore the extraordinary fortunes of these narratives, a complex cycle for which the collective title Daredevils of Sasun may be more representative. Heroes from the various branches of the epic became protagonists of Armenian poetry, drama, musical compositions, and art. The epic became a rich repository of artistic inspiration, political reflection, and meaning-making in the key, dramatic events of modern Armenian history, from the Genocide to the Communist Revolution, from Armenians participation in World War II to the war of independence for Arst‘akh (Nagornyj Karabakh). In 2012 the recitation of the Daredevils of Sasun was listed among UNESCO’s Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, and  it remains a living text into the present day. My chapter will walk the reader through this incredibly rich history, showing how the Daredevils of Sasun has shaped and continues to shape Armenian national consciousness, guiding reflections on Armenians’ place in the world, both within Armenia and the Diaspora."

				"description": "The only written version of the sacred book of the Maya K'iche', the Popol Vuh, that has survived to this day was most likely copied by the Spanish friar Francisco Ximénez from a mid-sixteenth-century manuscript preserved for posterity in the town of Chichicastenango. Many archaeologists and epigraphists posit, however, that the system of beliefs underlying the epic dates back a millenium before the Spanish conquest. Central themes of the Popol Vuh as we know it today include mythical cosmogony, the cyclical nature of time, anthropogony, the life cycle of vegetation, as well as the history and genealogy of the K'iche' people. To a large extent, mythical narratives owe their remarkable longevity and their capacity for re-emergence in works of art to the role they play in defining cultural identities. Recognising the Maya Book of Counsel as a national epic underlines the continuity of tradition between the pre-Hispanic civilisation and the modern Guatemalan nation. Yet the question of national identity remains complex in Guatemala, especially given the heterogeneity of its society and the deep trauma of the civil war (1960-1996). While the practice of incorporating elements of the Maya mythology into Guatemalan literary fiction has won international acclaim, including the 1967 Nobel Prize awarded to Miguel Ángel Asturias, it has also raised significant controversy. In recent decades, Maya activism has highlighted the importance of self-representation in both the political and the cultural arena. Accordingly, paradigms in critical studies have shifted towards decolonial perspectives, with increasing emphasis on indigenous Maya literary production. The focal point of the chapter, therefore, will be the topos of metamorphosis, interweaving the symbolism of the Popol Vuh and its reformulation in modern indigenous and non-indigenous fiction with a broader context of national identity in Guatemala/Iximulew."

				"description": "The narrative poem The Life of Sinuhe was composed around 1850 BCE and circulated throughout Egypt as part of court culture. The genre of ‘epic’ was not part of Ancient Egyptian writing, but the anonymous poet used a central genre—the tomb autobiography—to narrate a fictional official’s life spent in the Levant, staging it as a meditation about cultural identity and values. The poem focused on distinctively Egyptian practices as well as genres, but ran counter to much contemporaneous official discourse. It was subsequently used in ancient education, as well as inspiring later authors, and although the extent to which it was the pre-eminent classic remains uncertain, it was read for over 1,500 years. After decipherment, from the 1830s onwards, it came to be regarded as the greatest achievement of Ancient Egyptian literature, partly because its narrative form was accessible to modern readers, but also because its setting was reminiscent of biblical narratives. Its modern reception is a process of Americo-European appropriation, and Sinuhe is arguably perhaps the ancient Egyptian national poem for Egyptologists rather than Egyptians. Outside academia, the poem has often been trivialized and exoticized in ‘western’ culture, notably in the 1954 Hollywood film of Mika Waltari’s historical novel (1945), in sharp contrast to its empathetic retelling by Naguib Mahfouz as a romantic short story (1941). While Sinuhe is now regularly included in canonical selections of World literature, translators and commentators (myself included) are usually not Egyptian, and Ben Okri recently reconfigured the poem in terms of African spirituality (Changing Destinies, 2021). Despite its assimilative receptions, the poem’s appeal to modern international audiences arguably derives from its intensely culturally-specific affirmation of what it meant to be an Egyptian in the nineteenth century BCE."

				"description": "On February 18, 2004, the Mongolian president N. Bagabandi issued a decree calling on every Mongolian family to place a copy of the Secret History of the Mongols in an honored position in their home. This decree marked the decisive apotheosis of the Secret History of the Mongols, a mostly prose history of Mongolia’s founder and culture hero Chinggis (‘Genghis’) Khan, his ancestors and his son and successor Öködei. Written around 1252, the work passed through secrecy, rewriting, and virtual disappearance before being rediscovered in the early twentieth century and enshrined as the national epic of the Mongolian nation. The Secret History indeed embodies many features of the national epic: anonymous authorship, a founding role in Mongolian literature, a rich poetic voice, and miraculous signs of imperial destiny, all narrating the charismatic protagonists’ deeds of conquest and devotion. Yet although the history was rapidly recognized as the definitive account of the Mongol Empire’s founding, it remained secret during the time of the empire. Its account of Chinggis Khan and his wife Madame Börte contained episodes inappropriate for anyone outside the imperial family to know. And after the empire’s fall, the narrative was transformed into an apocryphal, supernatural legend-cycle while itself almost disappearing. As it was recovered in the early twentieth century, scholars identified the Secret History as an ‘epic chronicle.’ This reading muddied the work’s distinctively non-epic, indeed at times anti-epic, commentary on the empire’s rise. Indeed, a critique of the Secret History's ironic stance toward epic values is not just a modern concern, but one central to understanding the work in its original context."

				"description": "The creation of a Latvian epic runs back to the middle of the 19th century, when the first generation of Latvian intellectuals (the so-called Youngs Latvians) and representatives of national romanticism acknowledged literature and epic, in particular, as important vehicles for inculcating ideas of national identity and self-determination. After some decades of debate, the epic Lāčplēsis (‘Bearslayer’, 1888) by Andrejs Pumpurs proved to be the ideal ideological token, symbolically weighty enough to affirm the Latvian people as a nation, and to embodying the most important principles and values of the epoch; it   subsequently exerted profound influence upon Latvian society, literature, and culture. The epic is set in the 13th century, when ancient Latvian tribes were subjected to Teutonic crusaders, and when Latvian lands became the property of a foreign power for several centuries. This epic is a literary work that has disgested much mythological material and information from chronicles. The prototype of its hero is to be found in Latvian legends about strong men. Andrejs Pumpurs has melded his diverse materials to form a single, compelling character, a protagonist of totemic origin, enjoying a mythical connection to nature, whose ears (bear's ears) provide his source of strength. Attempts to combine the national with the superhuman energize Lāčplēsis, generally through strategic use of mythological material. Hellhole, Sunken Castle, Summit of the Gods are all locales worthy of detailed investigation. Most recently, however, it is not so much the text itself that has confirmed national epical status for Lāčplēsis, but rather adaptations into new media, including a landmark film and (in 1988) a rock opera that reawoke national aspirations."

				"description": "During the National Revival that began in the last third of the 18th century, the Czech ‘nation’ (ruled by Austrian Habsburgs for a quarter of millennium by then) was ‘revived’ by being inserted as a character into a narrative, defined as a community of shared language, and legitimised by literary works hailing for the most part from the Golden Age of the medieval Czech state. An eminent example of epic texts that defined what the overarching narrative should be is the Dalimil Chronicle, an Old Czech poem of uncertain authorship, written in the second decade of the 14th century and addressed to the new king John of Bohemia, the first representative of the non-native House of Luxembourg on the Czech throne. This chronicle is best known for its strikingly anti-German sentiment and its fierce defense of the rights of the Czech ‘tongue’ (‘jazyk’) in conflict with ‘Němci’, i.e., the ‘Mutes’ (incomprehensible foreign enemies, represented by the Empire as well as by the German-speaking burghers dwelling within the borders of Bohemia). Overall, the Dalimil Chronicle speaks to a world where competition between various linguistic and social groups is the norm; the best way that people can speak about themselves is in such a way that their competitors will be deterred from seeking to harm them. The idea of a defining struggle between Czechs and Germans enacted in such a world never really left Czech public discourse, and if we search for a ‘national epic’ along these lines, the Dalimil Chronicle is an obvious candidate. My chapter will place it in dialogue with another epic about survival in this Central European struggle: Jaroslav Hašek’s Good Soldier Švejk (1921–1923). We will focus on affinities between Hašek’s unfinished Great War novel and the medieval narrative tradition that, in a way, it displaced in the ‘informal curriculum’ of Czech literature in the 20th century."

				"description": "Since the Bulgarians did not constitute a separate community (millet) of the Ottoman empire, they were ‘discovered’ by ethnographers only in the earlier 19th century. In 1842, Ivan Bogorov published folk songs about Krali Marco, or King Marco, a hero of superhuman strength who fought against mythical creatures, other heroes, the Ottomans, and his wife. In the following decades the size of the collection increased to more than 130 texts. But did this comprise the national epic? Such a concept suggests a discursive function: it is supposed to mark the origin of a national literature, representing a past before history, sinking into the depths of mythology, shaping the cultural memory of the nation. But the song cycle about Krali Marco did not serve such functions well: it represented the Ottoman invasion rather than the two medieval Bulgarian kingdoms, and it lagged behind the origin of the national literature associated with the invention of the Cyrillic alphabet in the 9th century. Although it mentioned mythical creatures, their presence was too marginal to be treated as fully-fledged mythology; and while the memories of Krali Marco flooded the nation, they were shared by the Serbs and the Macedonians. Krali Marco's alleged prototype was actually a Macedonian lord who had fought for rather than against the Ottomans, and the prototypes of other heroes in the cycle seemed to be not only Macedonian or Bulgarian but also Serbian, Hungarian, Wallachian, Turkish, Tatar, and Albanian. The 1971 academic edition, assembling more than 600 songs, hoped to repair such dysfunctions, yet many argued that in the Bulgarian case the discursive function of national epic was actually performed by the novel, while others tried to compensate for the lack of a ‘proper’ epic by inventing or even forging alternatives."

				"description": "Bosnia and Herzegovina is renowned for its ethnic, religious, and linguistic diversity. Influenced by the Latin West and Byzantine/Ottoman East, the country’s literary traditions well reflect this diversity. Its poetry attracted the attention of the European West during the Enlightenment, when Italian traveller A. Fortis discovered Hasanaginica, a ballad circulated orally by the Bosnian Muslims, the translation of which (by Goethe) prompted Orientalist romanticised interpretations in the European West (by Walter Scott, inter alia). Other ethnic groups in Bosnia had their oral traditions, too, which during the 19th century highlighted Serbian and Croatian national ideologies. Amalgamating these ideologies was the life's work of Bosnian Franciscan, and prolific cultural commentator, Fr. Grga Martić (1822–1905). Nick-named the Bosnian Homer and pro-Serbian in his early years, Martić embraced the ideology of the Illyrian movement-- that propagated the national awakening of the Southern Slavs under the Habsburg rule and fostered links with other South-Slavic peoples. In his later years, however, Martić modified his views, affirming the national identity and interests of Bosnia-Herzegovina’s Catholics as Croats and subverting the country’s Ottoman administration. Although supporting particular ethnic and religious groups, Martić’s works influenced the narratives of ‘Others’ belonging to a common Bosnia and Herzegovina (e.g. the Bosniaks). Later, under Tito’s totalitarian regime, his poems were manipulated to construct, in public and formal education, a hybrid image of the country as a shared place of communist ‘brotherhood and unity.’ Aimed at showing how Martić’s verses were shaped and reshaped to validate and justify diverse views of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a ‘common living space,’ this contribution will focus upon the contexts behind their origin, and upon later interpretations."

				"description": "The nation--particularly in Exodus and Numbers--is not an abstract concept but rather a grand character whose history is fleshed out with remarkable literary power. It is a character with a distinct voice; it moans and groans, is euphoric at times, complains frequently, and rebels against Moses and God time and again. In exploring the Bible as national epic, I highlight the many anthropomorphisms by which a collective character named ‘Israel’ springs to life. I explore the representation of communal motives, hidden desires, collective anxieties, the drama and suspense embedded in each phase of the nation's life: from birth in exile, to suckling in the wilderness, to a long process of maturation with no definite end. I also call for a consideration of the Bible's penetrating renditions of national ambivalence. I read the rebellious conduct of the nation against the grain, probing the murmurings of the people, foregrounding their critique of the official line. The Bible does not provide a homogeneous account of nation formation, but rather reveals points of tension between different perceptions of the nation's history and destiny. The second part of this chapter concerns uses of the Bible as a foundational epic in the Israeli context. The Bible became a Zionist epos from the very outset. It served as the pioneers’ bridge between the land they had imagined and the land they found upon arrival, vital to their construction of a new national home. Exodus and the Book of Ruth were among the privileged texts in Zionist exegesis. Both were cherished as ancient tales depicting a blissful return to the Land of Israel. While taking into account the common evocation of these two tales in defining Israel’s goals, I also consider the ways in which modern Israeli writers rely on the Bible in expressing their critique of some of the nation’s founding dreams."

				"description": "This chapter will explore the relationship between nation-building and Dominican literature by exploring canonical texts like Manuel de Jesús Galván’s Enriquillo: novela historica (1882) (which has been famously defined as ‘a kind of national epic of the Dominican Republic’) and a less-studied text that appeared two years earlier, namely Salome Ureña de Henriquez’s long poem Anacaona (1880). It is well known that both novel and poem share the same anxieties felt by the Dominican elites in the process of fashioning a national identity after independence from Spain was declared in 1865. Specifically, both texts revisit the colonial origins of Hispaniola and engage in the erasure of the African presence in the Dominican Republic and of historical ties with neighbouring Haiti from the nation’s collective memory. The texts of Galván, Ureña, and others in the same tradition will be put in dialogue with other, more recent (epic) efforts like, for instance, Aída Cartagena Portalatín’s Yania Tierra: Poema documento (1981) and Manuel Rueda’s Las metamorfosis de Makandal (1998).  These too have revisited the past, but have brought to the fore, in different ways, perspectives and voices occluded and erased from the official, authorized memory of the nation, revealing, in the process, the existence of alternative ‘imagined communities.’"

				"description": "My chapter will focus upon twentieth and twenty-first century Chinese media adaptations of Journey to the West, the sixteenth-century novel that reimagined a Chinese monk’s pilgrimage from China to India to obtain Buddhist scripts.   The first section will give a telegraphic overview of how this epic journey was retold, re-visualized, and re-enacted through oral performances and printed literature, elite and folk art, regional opera and temple festivals, as well as cartoons, animation, opera, film, television and online games.  While exploring the potentials and limits of each medium, I argue that transmedia storytelling highlights the epic’s theme of translation and transformation.  The next section will discuss how Journey to the West served as a modern Chinese national allegory from the Second Sino-Japanese War to the Cultural Revolution with special focus on the animated films Princess Iron Fan (1941) and Uproar in Heaven (1964), which called for national unity against a common enemy and rebellion against the status quo.  The last section will focus on the production and reception of the 1986 CCTV television series Journey to the West, reached an unprecedented wide audience in China and beyond, having been re-broadcast more than 3000 times down to the present day.  With twenty-five episodes shot on location in many scenic parts of China, the cast and crew—recruited from various regional opera troupes, film studios and television stations—physically retraced the epic journey through iconic national landscapes and borderlands as well as reinvented its aesthetic traditions in a new popular medium.  I will conclude with some reflections on the series’ reverberations through different generations, ethnicities, diasporic communities and aesthetic afterlives."

				"description": "In October 2009, China added the Manas epic to UNESCO's list of intangible heritage in need of urgent safeguard on behalf of China's Kyrgyz minority. Neighbor Kyrgyzstan -- where a UNESCO-endorsed pageant to celebrate the epic as national heritage had been held in 1995 --  met the news with dismay and uproar. Ensuing debates on the meaning of tradition and the ownership of the epic revealed that motivations for transcribing the epic and the transcription practices differed, although in both cases the idea of salvaging an oral tradition from its imminent disappearance was paramount. On the side of Kyrgyzstan, written or sound records of the epic have been produced and preserved as acknowledgement or recognition of the artfulness of individual bards, and as evidence of the continuity or popularity of the tradition. On the side of China, a small team of scholars has repeatedly transcribed and re-transcribed the epic as performed by a single bard over a period of several decades in an attempt to canonize the tradition. Whether in Kyrgyzstan or in China, transcripts of the epic lay buried under dust for years until official institutions ‘transvalued’ them as ‘archives’ in the wake of UNESCO’s call to claim and protect intangible heritage. In this process of transvaluation, archival transcripts of the epic became valuable as tokens of state ownership, erasing the stories of their production. Yet, on both sides of the border, public memory keeps alive these stories and the experiences of suffering, coercion, subjection, and dispossession that they tell. This chapter examines how the value and meanings of Manas as a national epic are constructed and negotiated globally, transnationally, and locally."

				"description": "In 1791, the German philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder claimed that the Hungarian language would be forgotten in a few hundred years. It was an offhanded remark, just one sentence in many hundreds of pages. Yet Hungarians quoted it many times, and for a long time. On the one hand, they did not feel secure about the status of their language and culture in Central Europe, fearing the kind of assimilation that they had recently imposed upon other peoples. On the other hand, it was during this period that it became clear that their language was of Finno-Ugric origin, so their old stories of origin were cast into doubt. There was thus much debate in the nineteenth century about whether it were possible to create a national epic that was genuinely rooted in folk tradition, expressing the cultural strength of the modern Hungarian nation. My chapter centers on two attempts to create such an imagined Hungarian community. Following Virgil, Mihály Vörösmarty placed the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin in a mythological framework (Zalán's Flight, 1825); in contrast, János Arany wrote in his national epic that whichever nation breaks with the innocency of its mythological era is doomed to failure (The Death of Buda, 1863)."

				"description": "In The Flyting of Dunbar and Kennedie (c.1500-05), William Dunbar refers to his rival as an “Iersche brybour baird”, loosely translated as a 'Gaelic vagabond rhymer!' The stream of invective unleashed in this poetic battle of insults is both striking and revealing. Dunbar’s dismissive references to his opponent’s Gaelic heritage (Kennedy was from Carrick in South Ayrshire, at that time still Gaelic-speaking, and his mother was countess of Angus), in which he characterises Highlanders as filthy, poor, and thieving, emphasises for the modern reader the complexities of defining 'Scottishness.' For the border is not just with England – even that marker of national difference is a shifting, moveable line. Scottish borders can be real and imagined, linguistic and cultural; they mark the distinction between island and mainland, lowlands and highlands, Catholic and Protestant. This chapter examines the complexities of formulating a national identity in a country where national loyalties compete against local and regional relationships. Long poetic narratives like Barbour’s The Bruce (c. 1375) and Hary’s The Wallace (c. 1477) (both continuing to circulate in manuscript and print in the 16th century) speak to a Scottishness that seems firmly rooted in Anglo-Scots hostility, but the reality is inevitably more nuanced. This chapter traces developing depictions of Scottishness in literary texts and chronicles, from the Scots origin myth of Scota and Gathalos, to medieval depictions of national heroes like Wallace and Bruce, to Walter Scott’s depictions of the Highlands in the 19th century. The rise of political nationalism and the independence movement in the 20th century, the introduction of a devolved parliament, and SNP dominance of the Scottish political landscape add further dimensions to modern perceptions of what it is to be Scottish. The reality remains multifaceted and at times contradictory, features that continue to be reflected and shaped by the nation’s literature. "

				"description": "The Kǝbrä Nägäśt  (‘Glory of Kings’) was the foundational myth of the Solomonic Dynasty, which ruled the Christian kingdom of Ethiopia between 1270-1974 CE. This national epic is a tale of curiosity, faith, and patriotism; it rewrites Old Testament and Late Antique history on a grand scale. Expanding the biblical story of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba by the birth of a son, it propagates the Solomonic kings as the genealogical and spiritual heirs of the biblical Israelite and late antique Aksumite kingdoms. The text tells how the true Ark of the Covenant was transferred from Jerusalem to the Horn of Africa by Solomon’s Ethiopian son, Mǝnilǝk — but also how, in the 6th century, the Ethiopian king and Byzantine emperor divided the world between them. According to the Kǝbrä Nägäśt, Ethiopia — Ityop̣ya — was the new chosen land of Christianity, the noblest Christian kingdom on earth. Although the text’s colophon proclaims it to be a much older text, originally written in Coptic and Arabic, no such original has been found. A Coptic predecessor is now regarded as fictitious. Recent scholarship believes that the text was translated into the ancient Ethiopian language of Gǝʿǝz by the 1320s. Its importance to Ethiopian Christian self-image and state-image endured over time: the 1955 Ethiopian constitution drew on the Kǝbrä Nägäśt and declared the modern emperors of Ethiopia to be descendants of the Queen of Sheba and Solomon. Beliefs propagated in the Kǝbrä Nägäśt and concomitant visions of Ethiopian exceptionalism guided the policies and actions of political and religious leaders through the centuries, from 15th-century diplomacy to the Ethiopian victory against Italian colonizing forces of Adwa in 1896. Beyond its place in Ethiopian state rituals and law until 1974, the Kǝbrä Nägäśt still ranks among the most valuable texts Christian Ethiopians draw from to describe their place in the world, their conception of history, and their everyday, lived realities."

				"description": "Until the 18th century, Wales’s predominant national myth was one of dispossession and survival in the face of an implacable enemy, the Saxons. The story of lost sovereignty over the island of Britain and the determination of the Welsh to reclaim their homeland is told repeatedly in texts written in Welsh and Latin, ranging from the 10th-century prophecy Armes Prydein, ‘The Prophecy of Britain’, to Geoffrey of Monmouth’s Historia regum Britanniae of c. 1136. The most resonant examples of 'Welsh national epic' in the Middle Ages are the long poem, Y Gododdin, commemorating British losses against the Saxons, and the eleven prose tales of The Mabinogion which construct, variously, the survival of the Welsh against Norman incursions. The 18th and 19th centuries saw revival of antiquarian interest in the earliest Welsh manuscripts, with the first printed editions and translations appearing in London, and the antiquity of Y Gododdin and other texts attributed to Taliesin debated at length. The mid-19th-century translation of The Mabinogion by Lady Charlotte Guest interpellated new generations of readers in industrialized Wales who identified as Welsh but often did not speak or read Welsh. The reception of the national myth of British loss now began to focus on language loss as part of a teleological process of anglicisation. In the mid 20th century, modernist texts in Welsh and English by writers including Saunders Lewis and David Jones reimagined the Brythonic and Arthurian past as metaphors of linguistic and cultural survival. But as the dream of self-determination for Wales finally took shape as political devolution, the literary mood changed again. New retellings of ancient epic struggles emerged out of the defensive ruralism of the early 20th century into a confident substate nationalism; tales from the Mabinogion could be retold as parables of diversity and internationalism."

				"description": "Saveros Pou has brought to light the central position of the Rāmakerti in the court society of the ‘Middle Period.’ Studying that period, which corresponds to our premodern era, she has discovered sixteenth- and seventeenth-century manuscript sources that contain the first substantial written trace of the Cambodian version of the Indian epic Rāmāyaṇa. This text, which may be akin to a libretto, was put to a singular use: as a psalmodic accompaniment to the palace dancers, these stanzas, which have become a classic of Cambodian literature, participated in a royal eulogy that was intended to repair the dereliction of a world caught in the grip (it was believed) of chaos. Theatrically evoking the third age of the world (the dvāparayug, during which, according to the epic, Rāma, avatār of Viṣṇu, savior of all men who deserve salvation, is incarnated here on earth), the dancers exalted the glorious aspect of the reigning monarch, made one with Rāma, at once cakravartin king and boddhisattva, battling against the dark forces of Rāvaṇa, the demon king of Laṅkā, to spread the truth of Buddhism. In donning the masks and costumes of Rāma, Sītā, Rāvaṇa, or Hanumān on the occasions of royal ceremonies (enthronement, royal funerals, etc.), these dancers were not actors representing the golden age of a triumphant Buddhism associated with the ‘glory of Rāma’ (which is the meaning of the word Rāmakerti) but rather priestesses officiating at a religious celebration. There is every reason to believe that the divinity they summoned to sanctify the glory of the king was Umā, the consort of Śiva, who had long been charged with the protection of the realm. This was, in effect, one of many reconfigurations of the tutelar deity of the Angkor dynasty, the famous Devarāja."

				"description": "In this chapter, I establish St. Lucia’s national epic as its story of coming into artistic being in the face of innumerable colonial setbacks. At the heart of this exploration is a calibration of epicity that is the sum of the efforts of the poet and playwright, Derek Walcott; the dramatist, Roderick Walcott; the painter, Dunstan St. Omer; and the novelist, Garth St. Omer.  The creative activities of this quartet of St. Lucian artists go beyond the literary. Accordingly, my focus is on the wide-ranging artistic endeavors of these four men as they brought St. Lucia’s social, cultural, and natural landscape into focus. I argue that in their creative processes, they repurposed the topoi of the epic to suit an emergent national imaginary. Drawing inspiration from the island as muse—the land, the sea and the people—these Creatives harmonized a praisesong of their island.  Their polyvocal composition not only resonated deeply with a local audience, but also allowed St. Lucia—dubbed ‘Helen of the West’ for its incomparable beauty—to gain international acclaim, and to partake of the epic grandeur of the famed Helen of Troy. Sampling the pre-Independence creative works of this quartet, the chapter compares the strengths and successes of the different genres within which they were working.  Moreover, I explore how, in entering into aesthetic conversation with each other, the Walcott brothers and the St. Omer cousins were consciously and unconsciously theorizing the contribution of the artist to national history and values. I conclude by showing how these men, all active members of the now-defunct St. Lucia Arts Guild, formed a sustaining community that allowed for continued artistic growth and the propagation of deep intertextual influences.  Their legacies continue to enrich the island’s creative enterprises and allow for the ongoing composition of a national epic."

				"description": "The twin-island nation Trinidad and Tobago achieved independence from British colonial rule in 1962 and became a Republic in 1976.  Although small in geographical size, the country almost paradoxically requires the prefix “multi-” as a descriptor of its racial, ethnic, cultural, religious, and linguistic diversity due to the legacies of slavery, indentureship, and the migration of peoples from Europe, Asia, other Caribbean islands, and regions of the Americas to its shores. The southernmost island in the Caribbean, and just seven miles from Venezuela, Trinidad’s demographic trends continue to be influenced by this South American country. Home to the pitch lake, one of the seven wonders of the world, re-discovered by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1595 and immortalized, too, in the title of Trinidadian Alfred H. Mendes’s novel Pitch Lake (1934), Trinidad relies more on its petrochemicals than its tourism industry-- unlike Tobago and most of its Caribbean neighbors. In addition, there is a complex economic and sociopolitical history of having changed hands among the Spanish, French, and British during the days of European colonization—with Tobago also having experienced such attempts by the Swedes and the Dutch. Therefore, the islands have since the days of colonialism and political independence been charting and celebrating their own unique sense of national identities and forms of artistic expression even amid the throes of racism and racial politics, classism, colorism, neocolonialism, and other isms and schisms that are legacies of the past.  Its creative writers—emerging, contemporary, and canonical— among them the late Trinidad-born Nobel Laureate V.S Naipaul, have variously represented the triumphs and failures of these pre- and postcolonial conditions and environments in ‘epic’ literatures—in prose, poetic, and dramatic forms—which have contributed to the canonization of both the Trinidad and Tobago and Caribbean literary traditions."

				"description": "Ukrainian literature is in the special but not unique position of having two poems perform the role of national epic.  Traditionally, that role was assigned to Ivan Korliarevs’kyi’s  (1769-1838) poem Eneiida.  Published in 1798 as a travesty of Vergil’s Aeneid, it introduced Ukrainian literature in the vernacular.  Kotliarevskyi’s role as ‘father’ of the literature was assured even though the poem’s complete version appeared only posthumously in 1842. It was a huge success.  While recasting the Aeneid in burlesque terms it served as a comic encyclopedia of Ukrainian country life and customs, depicting peasantry and petty gentry and fondly revisiting old Cossack traditions.  The destruction of the Cossack stronghold of the Sitch in 1775 by Catherine II and the abolition of Ukrainian autonomy were reprised for his readers as the fall of Troy, and the wanderings of Aeneas brought Ukraine back not as political fact but as literary trope.    The burlesque poetics, however, also implied rustic innocence and simplicity and a tacit acceptance of provincial status in the Russian Empire.   By the Romantic period both the ideas and the burlesque poetics no longer rang true.  In the 1840s the literary scene was dominated by the national poet, Taras Shevchenko (1814-1861).  His early poem Haidamaky also appeared in 1842.  Part epic, part drama and lyrical meditation, it evoked a bloody 18th c. peasant uprising against the Polish gentry in a brooding and Byronic idiom that mesmerized his Ukrainian audience and was broadly discussed in Russian and Polish criticism. Its irony was utterly contemporary, and so were its complex narrative form and the poet’s anguish at having to revisit scenes of carnage in order to resurrect a sense of identity. Its focus on collective memory and on national liberation through ordeal and sacrifice are archetypal and resonate to this day."

				"description": "In 1889, the small kingdom of Serbia, having regained its independence from the four centuries long Ottoman rule barely a decade earlier, celebrated a great anniversary: five hundred years since the Battle of Kosovo (28 June 1389). Young King Aleksandar Obrenović joined state dignitaries in the old mediaeval capital of Kruševac to lay a foundation stone for a monument commemorating the battle. Its grandeur, heavily influenced by fashionable French academicism, departed significantly from the architecture of an Oriental kasaba, predominant in Serbian towns and cities during the Ottoman period. Depicting the most poignant verse from the Kosovo Cycle of Serbian epic poetry which so fascinated scholars in the early 19th century, the monument indicated the path chosen by the elites for state rebuilding. The epic poetry of the Kosovo Cycle, which formed the core of unifying, national narrative among the Serbs, dropped deep roots into the past, spanning the centuries between the doomed battle and the 19th-century present, borrowing from historical records, echoes from chroniclers, and abundant folk poetry, weaving a myth that still endures. Its full poetic glory, described by Jacob Grimm as 'an example of a clean and noble language without any narration gaps,' was finally codified in the late 18th and early 19th centuries by Vuk Stefanović Karadžić (1787-1864) and his followers. However, the turbulent 20th century brought many attempts to alter the myth and alter the sense of national self through political (mis)interpretation. This chapter will discuss how aggressive political agendas distort traditional materials, undermining the self-understanding of a national culture."

				"description": "Luís de Camões’s Os Lusíadas has resided at the center of Portugal’s literary canon since its publication in 1572. The voyage of Vasco da Gama from Portugal to India and back in 1497-99 is the historical backbone of the poem, with Gama’s arrival on the subcontinent traditionally viewed as an epic “achievement” in what is informally known as the “heroes of the sea” line of interpretation. The encounters of Gama and his crew with native Africans and Muslims (generally referred to categorically with the overarching and culturally blind label of “Moors”) along the entirely maritime route to India, the recitation of Portuguese history (distant and recent) with non-Christian peoples in a register of triumphant Christianity, and the telos of an eventual presence of Portugal around the globe are all facets of the poem that readers who wish to understand Os Lusíadas as a defense of Christian imperialism enlist in traditional, heroic interpretations of the poem. While Camões undeniably tells Gama’s and Portugal’s story in a celebratory key and consolidates Portugal’s identity as a seafaring nation (with its greatest epic achievement in the logic of the poem being the practice of high-seas navigation to the four corners of the earth), the poem also registers doubts and uncertainties about the imperial enterprise and Portugal’s preeminence on the global stage. This chapter charts readings and uses of the poem across the centuries that include interpretations that work against the traditional heroic understanding of the poem, and examines how Camões’s epic has been recruited to the realities and cultures of a diasporic and postcolonial world, including its survival in modern translations. It suggests that the criticisms of empire embedded in the poem point to later readings that transcend, reject, or overturn the imperial enterprise."

				"description": "José Rizal was executed by the Spanish colonial powers largely for his Spanish-language novel Noli Me Tangere (1887), which had helped to inspire the Philippine Revolution of 1896. Katipunero revolutionaries reportedly kept copies tucked into their pockets, and as recently as 1960, Philippine jurisprudence applied the ‘Maria Clara Doctrine,’ a reference to Rizal’s heroine, in cases of rape. The 1956 Rizal Law (Republic Act No. 1425) mandated that all public and private schools, colleges and universities should include courses on the life, works, and writings of the national hero, particularly the novel Noli Me Tangere and its sequel El Filibusterismo. This required novel is matched only, and only distantly, in the national literary and public imaginary by Francisco Baltazar’s Tagalog epic awit poem Florante at Laura (1838), set in Albania and Turkey. The preeminent classic of Tagalog poetry, Noli Me Tangere itself references it when the wise man Tasio muses: “Mahusay na makata at mahusay mag-isip si Baltazar” (Baltazar is a great poet and thinker). This chapter on Philippine national epics will study the production and circulation of Noli Me Tangere under four flags: Spanish, American, Japanese, and Filipino. We will explain the key place that Noli Me Tangere occupies in theorizing nationalism, on the one hand, and world literature, on the other, particularly the novel. It will show the production and circulation of Rizal's text as key to imagining the Philippine epic of nationalism, with a contrast to Baltazar and Florante at Laura, amounting to the triumph of the novel over poetry in narrativizing nationalism. We will also interrogate the two national epics by analyzing their respective aesthetics and politics of love, as they relate to theorizations of the nation-state, the affect of nationalism, and the process of nationalizing writ large."

				"description":"Is there still something we could call a Norwegian national epic? And what would qualify as ‘Norwegian national’? Should we delimit ourselves to works emerging after Norwegian independence from Denmark in 1814? In that case, there are certainly ‘great’ literary works that spring to mind. Starting in our own times, we might consider Karl Ove Knausgård’s Min kamp, with its endless stream of trivial, everyday detail, a quintessential expression of (post)modern Scandinavian life. There are not many historical novels to pick from, but Sigrid Undset’s Kristin Lavransdatter (1920–22) would be a candidate. Among the works of Henrik Ibsen, Norway’s first and still most prominent contribution to world literature, the verse drama Peer Gynt (1867) is often depicted as particularly ‘national’. From the nineteenth century we would also have to consider the folklore collected and published in the heydays of National Romanticism, foremost the fairy tales and medieval ballads. However, taking a broader historical perspective, it is hard to come up with anything whose Wirkungsgeschichte and continued influence can compare to Snorre Sturlason’s sagas of the medieval kings of Norway, Heimskringla, written in the early thirteenth century. That would leave us in the awkward position of appropriating a work written in Icelandic, by an Icelander, in Iceland as ‘Norwegian’. At the same time, however, it will allow us to untangle a not at all unique history of the heteronomous genealogy of the national. The history of Heimskringla is a history of migration and empire, language loss and translations, of changing systems of cultural circulation, of conflicts between Nordic hegemonial ambitions and nation state aspirations, of endless retranslations, rewritings, remediations and reappropriations."

				"description": "Of all the nations of Africa, Nigeria is arguably the most closely associated with literary production. From a global perspective,  this literariness is enshrined in the figures of Chinua Achebe, the acclaimed ‘father of modern African literature,’ author of  the most widely-read African novel, Things Fall Apart (1958) and of one of the most controversial critical essays of the twentieth century, 'An Image of Africa: Racism in Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness,' and Wole Soyinka, the first African to win a Nobel Prize for Literature (1986), whose variegated work is infused with epical, nation-making allure. In recent years, such writers as Ben Okri and Chimamanda Adichie have come to signify Nigerian literary prowess in the world republic of letters. Their work, however, has unleashed less revolutionary power than that of their predecessors, whose oeuvre is reflective not just of the tides of history, but of their own subjectivities as intellectuals and historical actors. In Nigeria itself, however, validation of these writers and their work intersects with a more complex sense of literariness, inextricable from Nigeria’s sense of self as a nation. Beyond some of the acclaimed works by world-renowned writers, the body of writing taken to be indicative of national character heavily features texts that do not circulate globally. This chapter explores the fraught relationship between what the world considers Nigerian epics and their configuration in the country itself. It pays close attention to aesthetic nuances and historical contingencies, and to the role of literature syllabi and mass and social media in shaping Nigerian national epics (and so problematizing widely-held notions about Nigerian writing). It will make a case for what the scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. defines as the ‘Talmudic’ role of scholars in the resurrection, preservation, and the projection of the country’s less-known national epics onto the world stage."

				"description": "When Petar Petrović Njegoš II, the Prince-Bishop of Montenegro, died in Cetinje in 1851 aged only 37, the mausoleum he had designed and begun building atop Mount Lovćen a few years earlier was still not complete. Literary romanticism was in full bloom among the Balkan Christians. The monumental epic poem of Njegoš known as The Mountain Wreath reworked traditional poems of the Kosovo Cycle (which centered on the famous battle of 1389).   Published in 1847, Njegoš's poem spoke to the struggle against the Ottoman rule which engulfed the Balkans since the early 1800s. The epic's dedication  evokes the chief generals of the Napoleonic era as ‘offspring of Bellona’ but above them all Njegoš puts Karađorđe, leader of the First Serbian Uprising (1804-1813). Thus Njegoš’s dying wish that, from his final resting place, he might ‘oversee all Serbian lands’ symbolically married the sense of national selfhood among highlanders of Montenegro with that of other Serbs. Until World War I, Njegoš laid undisturbed in his chapel, overseeing the liberation and growth of Montenegro. In 1916, however, the occupying Austro-Hungarian authorities raised the chapel to the ground, while Njegoš’s remains were transferred to the Monastery of Cetinje. Restored in 1925, the church once again received the Prince-Bishop. But not for long. After World War II, the new communist authorities, aiming at containing the Serbs within Yugoslavia, proclaimed the Montenegrins a separate nation and ordered demolition of Njegoš’s chapel. Yet another new mausoleum was built in 1974, but this directly contradicted Njegoš’s will by making no reference to his status within the Serbian Orthodox Church. The 1990s brought new insurgencies, new wars, and new interpretations of  The Mountain Wreath, rendering the status of Njegoš as an epic national poet once again uncertain."

				"description": "Ngugi wa Thiong’o’s recent Kenda Mūiyūru, (The Perfect Nine), is rooted in the orature that Ngugi has championed in the last several decades. It relates a Gikuyu myth of origin that Jomo Kenyatta wrote about in Facing Mount Kenya. The dominance of the Gikuyu in political life in Kenya has contributed to the cultural capital of the myth. Paradoxically, Ngugi’s treatment of the myth in the form of epic written in Gikuyu makes it both a more idiomatically Gikuyu myth and an epic about world building, and therefore belonging to the lineage of classical European philosophical epics. The English version uses recognizably Virgilian and Homeric tropes, but also echoes philosophical cosmogonies like those of Lucretius and Bernardus Silvestris. Earlier epic forms on the Swahili coast are implicated in an older and even more complex cultural and political tradition. They are the product of a millennium-long interaction between the east coast of Africa and centers of rule across the Red Sea. A rich literary culture on the islands of Lamu and Pate shapes epics such as the eighteenth-century Utendi wa Tambuka, an account of the theological and military conflict between Muslims and the Byzantines. A more philosophical poem, informed by Sufi asceticism, the Al-Inkishafi, by the poet and theologian Sayyid Abdallah, anticipates the fall of Pate. It becomes the armature of a number of later Swahili works written in—and about—post-independence Tanzania. The 2019 novel The Dragonfly Sea by Yvonne Owuor Adhiambo returns to a modern Pate, now a neglected backwater. Adhiambo excavates a history that places Pate at the center of a premodern geopolitics centered on China, but sutures this together with a present in which geopolitical interests in Kenya are once again shifting toward China."

				"description": "For Germans, the national epic remains a vexed question. Before 1945, the medieval Nibelungenlied would have been the obvious candidate. But because of the poem’s major role both in imperial Germany’s and, even more so, in the Nazis’ nationalist propaganda, the text became irredeemably tarnished in the capacity of a ‘national epic’. Besides, the poem’s tradition as national epic was a fairly recent one, a product of nineteenth-century German philology’s attempt to provide ideological legitimacy for the nation state established in 1871. Thus, after World War II, more recent literary artefacts began unofficially to jostle for the role of encapsulating Germany’s cultural and historical identity. Divided along the faultlines of the Cold War, the two German states succeeding the Reich, each in its own specific way, had to deal with the legacies of defeat, tyranny and genocide. In both states, the ideal of nationhood was frequently downplayed or even rejected, and hence texts were privileged that focused on regional identities, on bourgeois cultural traditions, served as allegories of the Nazi era or deliberately promoted the identity of the GDR as a socialist nation. From 1990 onwards, the unexpected unification of the two Germanies raised the problem of national identity in new and unprecedented ways. The reluctance as well as ironic fatalism felt by many Germans vis à vis the return of the nation state is perhaps best expressed in Wolfgang Becker’s 2003 movie Good Bye Lenin which, for all its humour, conceives of the national experience in terms of profound melancholy. Paying attention to the issues and phenomena sketched above, this contribution gauges the degree to which, given the country’s twentieth-century history, the very notion of a national epic can still be possible within a German context."

				"description": "The Knight in the Panther’s Skin by Shota Rustaveli (c. 1160- c. 1220), the book most loved by Georgians, is revered by some as highly as the Bible or the Constitution. There are about 140 manuscripts of the poem, which over the centuries has been endlessly and variously adapted and translated into more than 50 languages. Brides still receive a copy with their dowry. Despite numerous attempts at erasure, by friend or foe, it still holds a place of distinction in the Georgian polyphonic cultural genome, and is truly sui generis. The architectonics of the poem are largely complete, and its individual parts lie in pleasing proportion to the main body. In a style uncommon to his contemporaries, Rustaveli adroitly manages individual and typological features of his characters. Balancing poetic fantasy against objective representation, he shows realistic understanding of worldly affairs. While defining and expanding its geography into stories of Arabia and India, the poem clearly engages with the socio-political and economic conditions in the kingdom of Georgia. Taken to mark the onset of a  Georgian Golden Age, the poem is regarded as an “unset pearl,” and has never lost curricular relevance in schools or universities. Its literary style and original language are still comprehensible in today’s diverse classrooms as well as university auditoria, and the pandemic has prompted online teaching of the poem through <a href='https://1tv.ge/video/qartuli-abiturientis-dro-didi-wignebi-vefkhistyaosani-teleskola/'>TV-School</a>. But where does Rustaveli come from? His poem is deeply rooted in Georgian language, culture, folklore, and fundamental obligations of hospitality. This chapter will examine Rustaveli’s poem from its points of origination, through myriad adaptations and into its remarkable socio-cultural relevance in the nation of Georgia today."

				"description": "Subverting the classicist project of national epic-making by placing gods and epic heroes in everyday environments with workaday speech, the genre of travesties or mock epics came to the Slavic lands via the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century West European literary tradition. The Aeneid Turned Inside Out [Eneida navyvarat] is a Belarusian burlesque poem dating from the 1820s. Written by an anonymous author and imitative in nature, it is considered today to be a founding text of the Belarusian national literary tradition (as one of the first secular works written in the Belarusian vernacular to be widely circulated). This chapter discusses the impact of this text on the development of Belarusian literary language as the first articulations of national consciousness. It does this by comparing The Aeneid Turned Inside Out to both its Russian and Ukrainian sources, and the Belarusian texts that followed. The two direct Slavic literary sources for this poem are the Russian travesty by Nikolai Osipov and Alexander Kotelnitsky titled Vergil’s Aeneid Turned Inside Out (1791–1796), and Ukrainian The Aeneid. Transposed into the Little Russian Language by I. Kotliarevs′kyi (1798, 1808). Another point of comparison is Taras on Mount Parnassus [Taras an Parnase] (1851; 1889), a later Belarusian mock epic attributed to Kanstantsin Veranitsyn. The chapter concludes by showing how critical reception of The Aeneid Turned Inside Out became a site for negotiating national identity for generations of later readers."

				"description": "Voltaire, while exiled in London for attacking the French monarchy, discovered Milton's Paradise Lost, Shakespeare’s plays, and a democratic society where the epic, whether in straight or parodic form (Pope, The Rape of the Lock) was one of the most fruitful modes of literature. Voltaire had already tried his hand at epic form in composing his Henriad, extolling Henri IV, a Protestant who converted to Catholicism to bring the Wars of Religion to an end. But the Henriad, while enjoying some success, failed to mark a new departure for the epic genre in France. 'The French,' concluded a disappointed Voltaire, 'have no head for epic (Les Français n’ont pas tête épique).  His fateful dictum has been treated as gospel, more or less, ever since. But the French revolution, and the Napoleonic wars in its wake, would give Voltaire's prediction the lie. If the French had no head for epic, what about French feet in revolutionary crowds, and the Grande Armée, marching out across the continent? The question of epic would indeed come alive again with the rising European nationalisms of the XIXth century, obliging France to search for a lost 'national epic.' But where was it to be found?"

				"description": "The Mahābhārata (“The Great Story of the Bhāratas”) is the monumental national epic of India, even though the other great epic Rāmāyaṇa complements its significance for contemporary Indians, especially Hindus.  More than 2500 years old, the epic continues to serve as both an analogical and allegorical template to delineate historical, social, political, and ethical changes during epochal crisis points punctuated by transforming ideas about nationhood.  This chapter will accordingly trace the formation and reformation of Indian nations as epiphenomena of a transforming range of epic readings.  Some argue that the original epic underwrites for the imperial Mauryas (200-400 BCE) a mythic conception of Bhāratavarṣa or Bhārata, an enduring name for the Indian nation (as enshrined in the 1948 Constitution: “India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States.”)  In the late colonial period, the Mahābhārata served to define fault lines between Indian nationalists and the British Raj, mapping the epic theme of restoring stolen lands to their rightful heirs (now represented by the Indian Independence movement).  Chakravarti Rajagopalachari, the last Governor-General of India and English translator of both Sanskrit epics, captures a nationalist mood in prefacing his Rāmāyaṇa translation: “The real need of the hour is a re-communion between us and the sages of our land ... Our classics really embody our national character in all its aspects and it is well the world sees us as we really are, apart from what we wish to become… [The epics] bind our vast numbers together as one people, despite caste, space and language that seemingly divide them.”  The Mahābhārata still today satisfies traditional acculturative needs, but is also frequently repurposed by diverse communities to contest those very nationalist formulations that it helped define a few generations earlier."

				"description": "If a national epic may be defined as a narrative that tells the story of a people in a land that they consider their own, and their struggles against those who challenge their claim to that land, then the Shahnameh may be considered Iran’s national epic. Two features of the Shahnameh justify this characterization. First, its narrative remains available to Persian speakers because literary Persian has changed little over the past millennium. Second, it is neither the story of an individual nor a heroic clan but the tale of Iran and the Iranian people. Unlike European epics that were rediscovered and put to use in nationalist projects quite recently, a literary form of Iran’s heroic traditions has been the focal point of national identity since the 4th century BC. This tradition was adopted by Muslim historians of the 7th century AD, who incorporated it into their narratives in Arabic. The rise of literary Persian in the 9th century led to the creation of a massive prose story of Iran from the first primordial king to the Arab conquest. This was commissioned by an Iranian aristocrat and was completed in April of 957 AD by a team of scholars. Ferdowsi’s Shahnameh—completed in 1010 AD—is a versification of this prose original.  The poem and its poet have been cultural icons since the 12th century. With the rise of modern nationalism in Iran and the renovation of Ferdowsi’s mausoleum (built between 1928-1934, remodeled in 1969) Iranians flock to his tomb during national holidays.  This chapter examines the significance and impact of Iran’s epic tradition on the country’s national consciousness."

				"description": "When Britain annexed Aotearoa/New Zealand in 1840, Aotearoa’s tangata whenua (indigenous Maori peoples) conceived of identity in terms of iwi (tribal) rather than national affiliation. By the time of Aotearoa/New Zealand’s sesquicentenary, many Maori still embraced the notion of ‘many different nations which make up the indigenous population of Aotearoa’ (Rika-Heke 1997: 171-2). However, the experience of colonisation did prompt Aotearoa’s indigenous peoples to develop a new sense of themselves as a constituency of Maori (one meaning of this word is ‘normal’) in relation to the tauiwi (British settlers), who were given the name ‘Pakeha’ as a way of distinguishing between the outsiders and the tangata whenua. This binary has profoundly inflected national(ist) discourses and literatures that developed in Aotearoa/New Zealand, enduring into the present alongside other strands added by the multiple ethnic communities that migrated to Aotearoa/New Zealand during and beyond the 19th century. This chapter explores the work of key authors of multiple ethnicities who have produced what may be termed national ‘epics’, or explorations of cultural and literary nationalism, since the late 19th century, when Pakeha authors began developing literary models that moved away from British exemplars towards local specificities (which I will also trace through the works of Katherine Mansfield). I will also explore the literary/cultural nationalist movement of the 1930s (spearheaded by Pakeha authors such as Allen Curnow, A.R.D. Fairburn and Frank Sargeson), with reference to the work of female authors (such as Janet Frame and Robin Hyde) marginalised by the masculinist bias of this movement, before considering a range of work by Maori authors (including Witi Ihimaera and Patricia Grace) and writers of Asian and Pacific descent (including Selina Tusitala Marsh, Albert Wendt and Alison Wong) who have contested dominant Pakeha perspectives in producing their own reflections upon Aotearoa/New Zealand as a multi-ethnic nation."

				"description": "My chapter will bear out George Brandes’ claim, made in his 1903 “study of the land, people, and literature” of Poland, that in Adam Mickiewicz’s 1834 poem Pan Tadeusz “Poland possesses the only successful epic [the nineteenth] century has produced.” I first outline briefly the epic tradition in Polish literature, from Piotr Kochanowski’s 1618 translation of Tasso’s Gerusalemme Liberata to (the miscarried) efforts to produce a national epic according to classicist specifications. I then situate Pan Tadeusz within the tradition of Western foundational epics, epitomized by Vergil’s Aeneid, on the one hand; and the romantic horizon of expectations (as articulated above all by the Polish critic Maurycy Mochnacki) of what might constitute a national epic, on the other, with a view toward the Herderian—modern—concept of nation. As such, Pan Tadeusz constitutes a “social drama” (Victor Turner) that enacts the passage of an effete premodern society on the verge of extinction to a revitalized, nationally conscious collective. I conclude by arguing that the poem’s status as Poland’s national epic is as much a function of its reception by the immediate, post-romantic generation as it is by Mickiewicz’s epic intentions."

				"description": "'I could construct seven different Kalevalas from the poems I have collected so far', wrote the physician Elias Lönnrot (1802–1884) in 1848. While revolutions convulsed most of Europe, the Finnish intelligentsia concentrated on forging a collective identity from the former easternmost provinces of the Swedish kingdom. Publication of the Kalevala was key to this nation-building. This book of Finnish-language folk poems was from its first edition (1835; extended version 1849) honored as 'the national epic of the Finns'; one of the poorest, most scarcely-populated corners of North-Eastern Europe thus provided one of the most succesful national epics in the Europe of romantic nationalism. However, the Kalevalaic storyworld's decisive cultural breakthrough came only in the late nineteenth century, as the language of culture and learning, politics and economics changed from Swedish to Finnish. The 50 poems and almost 23000 verses of the Kalevala are set in the pagan past, and its narrative arches from an archaic creation myth to the arrival of Christianity. The Kalevala has inspired a wide variety of painters, architects, musicians and writers in Finland. Restaurants, insurance companies, banks, newspapers, icebreakers, items of jewellery, matchboxes and crispbread brands all carry names of Kalevalaic heroes. Generations of school kids have struggled with its trochaic metre and illustrated its poems in their art classes, although cother national narratives are now usurping its canonical role in school curricula. The book has been translated into more than 60 languages, inspiring, for example, H.W. Longfellow and J. R. R. Tolkien. Lately, ultra-nationalistic right-wing ”pseudohistories” have capitalized on its images of archaic Finnishness. So although the average Finn reads Lönnrot' s text less than ever, it it continues to permeate Finnish national culture of the 21st century."

				"description": "The turbulent first hundred years of the Greek State (1828-1923) were formative in developing a modern national identity. Major political and social upheavals led to extensive changes in the intellectual life of the young country. The Homeric epics formed part of the education of the Greek-speaking elite throughout the Byzantine empire, but the two long poems (very different in character and poetic style) never became national epics. Only after the formation of the Modern Greek state did the Homeric texts assume some national epic characteristics-- but they were read in translation, since their archaic poetic diction was incomprehensible for most readers. The discovery of vernacular redactions of the Byzantine Tale of Digenis Akritis in the later nineteenth century, and of associated folk-songs with Digenis as hero, suggested that this material belongs to an epic that could be called national. My chapter will examine various aspects of the presence of Homer and of the Digenis Akritis in Greece. Translations and popularizations of the ancient epics gained political charge around the turn of the 20th century, and the travails of Odysseus in the Odyssey served as a metaphor for the fate of Greek people over centuries as exiles and immigrants. Various adaptations of the Digenis were made for the stage in heroic or even comic guises. This chapter will include input from high-school students from Thessalonica who have been been taught Homer and the Digenis at school-- which leads us to question whether any text currently serves as “national epic” or even “anti-epic” as the country struggles to recover from the financial crisis of 2009 and the pandemic."

				"description": "On April 21st, 1971, a large crowd of people gathered at the harbor in Reykjavík, Iceland. It was a cold day, yet the atmosphere was festive; people were dressed in their finest, children were lined up at the quay and fluttering flags were in abundance. The cause for celebration was the arrival of a coast guard ship from Denmark, bringing as its unusual cargo two medieval manuscripts to be delivered to the Icelandic nation as one of the earliest and unparalleled gestures of cultural offering and repatriation. The event marks in many ways the apex of a process of cultural identity-formation in Iceland; a consolidation of the past into a single symbolic narrative mediated in the textual manifestation of that past, that is the Íslendingasögur (the sagas of Icelanders) and the eddic poems. This chapter will elaborate on the process of self-realization and actualization of a national identity via literary history, more specifically through the cultural history provided by the sagas as a memorial to settlement, community-building, and cultural inheritance. It will discuss the role of the mythographical poems and the sagas as national epics and their role within literary history more broadly. Finally, it will contend with the vexed issue of national identity and belonging being affirmed through lineage and heritage and the frequently problematic appropriation and reformulation of literary history for such purposes."

				"description": "The classic Korean novel The Story of Hong Gildong narrates the adventures of the title character, an illegitimate son of a nobleman who leaves home to become the intrepid leader of outlaws who steal from the wealthy and punish the corrupt, and then leaves the country with his followers to become the ruler of his own island kingdom.  In modern Korea, it has become the best-known epic from traditional literature, often used to speak of the ingenuity, resilience, and dynamism of the Korean people.  Unfortunately, much of the scholarly understanding of the work itself has been marred by a series of historical myths concerning its production, in particular that it was written by an aristocratic writer in the early seventeenth century, inspired by the great Chinese bandit epic Water Margin.  In actuality, it appears to have been composed in the middle or late nineteenth century, when Joseon dynasty Korea was undergoing tremendous change and decline due to the pressures of modernity and foreign intervention.  There is evidence to show that The Story of Hong Gildong was a popular work at the time of its publication, but its rise as a kind of national epic did not occur until the modern era, through countless retellings in film, television, novels, and comic books.  In that sense, the Hong Gildong story that most Koreans are familiar with is largely a modern reinvention of the classic character, oftentimes serving specific political and cultural functions of the contemporary period.  This chapter examines the transformation of the figure from classic literature to its iconic status in the modern Korean imagination."

				"description": "Saxo’s History of the Danes (Gesta Danorum), finished around 1208, has all the credentials of a national epic: it is of venerable age, it is long (c. 750 pp), it makes grand claims for a small nation, it is written in artful prose and even includes extensive poems, it is heroic, it covers an impressive timespan. But for the romantic intellectuals it came with one fatal flaw: it was written in Latin. The book therefore never got even close to the status of the otherwise comparable Heimskringla in Norway or Nibelungen in Germany. In my chapter I will focus on the prolific romanticist decades c. 1800-1830 in which the new desire for a national epic text circled in frustration around Gesta Danorum and other texts – incl. Beowulf with its Danish setting. The main protagonist of my piece is the leading figure of N.F.S. Grundtvig (1783-1872), translator, author, national mobilizer, churchman and more, seconded by the popular author B.S. Ingemann (1789-1862) and scholars such as C. Molbech (1783-1857) and P.E. Müller (1776-1834). Their romantic aspirations for revitalizing the heritage of pagan or medieval Danish culture were sharpened by the national disasters following in the wake of Denmark’s siding with Napoleon: a national bankruptcy was declared in 1813, and the following year the monarchy lost Norway. The search for an epic produced much excellent literature and scholarship, but ultimately failed. Since then the Danish canon developed along multiple lines, but would never count a medieval classic as part of it. Perhaps new translations as well as global Latin and global English is about to get Saxo more readers than ever before."

				"description": "On the face of it, the story of William Tell, who retaliates for being forced to shoot an apple from his son’s head by assassinating the Habsburg governor, epitomises the desire of the Swiss for liberation from foreign oppressors. As with all national stories, however, Tell can mean different things to different constituencies. This chapter will initially survey the genesis of the story in the late fifteenth century at the time of Swiss independence from the Habsburgs, together with its early development in drama, lyric and chronicle, in particular, Aegidius Tschudi’s Chronicon Helveticum. It will then examine its successive appropriations, first by the French Revolution, and second by Schiller, whose play Wilhelm Tell (1804) promulgates romantic ideals of individual freedom and liberation distinct from self-interested political violence. By the mid-nineteenth century, in tune with their constitutionalisation, the Swiss seem to have decided to accept this German play as a mirror of their national identity, troping Schiller \"the German poet with the Swiss heart.\" The play continued in annual production throughout the twentieth century, ideologically divided between largescale, lay productions valorising a conservative vision of the nation, and art-house productions critiquing the potentially right-wing implications of its patriotism. Further important post-war responses include Max Frisch’s Wilhelm Tell für die Schule (1971), and the 2014 film, Schweizer helden, in which Schiller’s play is performed by asylum seekers.  However, some of the most thought-provoking revisions of Tell in the modern age are not textual but iconographic. Finally, this chapter will explore the images of Tell created by Richard Kissling (1895), and Ferdinand Hödler (1897), and their re-animation in twentieth-century Swiss political posters to support positions from the extreme left to the extreme right, along with the series of psychoanalytic William Tell paintings produced by Salvador Dali in the 1930s."

				"description": "The nation now known as Romania has a long and complex history. Indigenous peoples yield to Greek and Roman colonization, with Mongol and later Ottoman incursions resisted by Moldavian, Transylvanian, and Wallachian principalities. Architects of a cohesive Romanian identity drew from rich but multifarious materials in shaping novels and then state-sponsored films. National emergence is figured as an epic journey; Romania and the Republic of Moldova make different selections from overlapping sources. Maintenance of a nation-wide culture, as opposed to regional or ethnic self-identification, was a pressing concern for the Bucharest elites well into the 20th century. Novels, and later state-sponsored films, realized Romanian ethno-genesis through victories of ethnic Romanians on the battlefields of medieval Wallachia and Moldovia, or, reaching further back, Rome's conquest of Dacia . Films of this kind feature iconic Dacian kings or medieval princes as heroes of the nation, not as heroic individuals. From the later 19th century onwards, epic metaphors of Romanian self-definition ascribe ominous agency to the East (traditionally, to the Ottoman and the Russian Empires). Romania, from the backwaters of Eastern Europe, thus strives to align itself with the West, developing the grand narrative of a relatively new nation that prides itself on speaking one of the five major Romance languages-- uniquely, in Eastern Europe. Mihail Sadoveanu (1880-1961) and Nicolae Dabija (1948-2021) argued for the rights of Romanian nationals in contested borderlands, using the perceived clout of their native tongue (as a nation-building tool) and fictionalizing history. Sadoveanu, author of historically-themed novels adapted to the big screen, became a household name for Romanian-speaking audiences. Dabija, as a nationally-minded Romanian writer of the Republic of Moldova, shows how national identity might be actualized through Romanian literary culture in the post-Soviet republic."

				"description": "What is your national epic? Both terms are a challenge for Australia, a settler nation with origins in the history of British colonialism. Here and now, the thing that characterizes Australia as a nation is unresolved sovereignty, a latent sentiment that is growing fast and deeply felt. The sovereignty of white Australia is mainstream and dominant—including the English language enshrined in foundational documents like the Constitution—but also unstable, incomplete, and illegitimate for an increasing number of Australians. First nation Australians are asserting their claims to a sovereignty that was never ceded. ‘Always was, always will be Aboriginal land’ is a powerful dictum in public discourse. These shifts must inflect the idea of national epic. As elsewhere, the reality of the Australian nation is in process rather than resolved. There is no single Australian national epic. Candidates include Marcus Clarke’s convict novel For the Term of His Natural Life (1870-1872, 1874), Eleanor Dark’s trilogy of national settlement The Timeless Land (1941), James McAuley’s sectarian poem of maritime discovery Captain Quiros (1964) and Patrick White’s The Tree of Man (1955).  We will focus primarily on novels that, in containing history and envisioning nation, can be counted as epics. Henry Handel Richardson’s trilogy, The Fortunes of Richard Mahony (1930) and Alexis Wright’s Carpentaria (2006) trace an arc along which time, nation and history refract through life-stories of individually conceived but representative characters. These novels share formal aspects germane to the epical work of nation: each reworks the European and modern novel. Richardson reworks the structural achievements of the realist novel to historicize a nation through the tragic life of her protagonist while Wright reconceptualizes the magical realist novel’s form and language to write Aboriginal deep time."

				"description": "The island of Martinique (Martinican Matinik or Matnik) lies directly north of St Lucia and (further south) Trinidad. As a départemente of France, it is a special territory of the European union, and its currency is the euro. Almost everyone on the island speaks French and Martinican creole; the speaking of Kalinago, an Arawakan language, faded in the early twentieth century under intense colonialist pressure. Three of the most influential anti-colonialist writers of the region (or of any region) emerged from Martinique: Aimé Césaire (1913-2008), Franz Fanon (1925-1961), and Édouard Glissant (1928-2011). Texts such as Aimé Césaire's Cahier d'un retour au pays natal, (1939) and Fanon's The Wretched of the Earth (1961), and also the work of Glissant, contribute to and draw from the movement of négritude, which was also shaped and documented by women writers. Jeanne Nardal (1900-1993) and Paulette Nardal (1896-1985), theorized the movement and laid important connections with the Harlem Renaissance; Suzanne Césaire edited Tropiques, the most influential Francophone Caribbean journal. Édouard Glissant was shortlisted for the Noble Prize in 1992, when it was awarded an epical poet from the island fifty miles to the south: Derek Walcott (see 'St Lucia' chapter). Many major writers from Martinique were drawn to contemplation of wide, epical spaces: Glissant developed a notion of Antillanité, evoking a space stretching to Latin America, whereas Aimé Césaire emphasized African cathections. Landscapes of Martinican space remain of vital concern today, as writers ponder relations between poetry and ecology in light of what is now a distinguished, and highly influential, literary tradition."
