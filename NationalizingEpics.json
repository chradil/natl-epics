				"description": "My chapter will focus upon twentieth and twenty-first century Chinese media adaptations of Journey to the West, the sixteenth-century novel that reimagined a Chinese monk’s pilgrimage from China to India to obtain Buddhist scripts.   The first section will give a telegraphic overview of how this epic journey was retold, re-visualized, and re-enacted through oral performances and printed literature, elite and folk art, regional opera and temple festivals, as well as cartoons, animation, opera, film, television and online games.  While exploring the potentials and limits of each medium, I argue that transmedia storytelling highlights the epic’s theme of translation and transformation.  The next section will discuss how Journey to the West served as a modern Chinese national allegory from the Second Sino-Japanese War to the Cultural Revolution with special focus on the animated films Princess Iron Fan (1941) and Uproar in Heaven (1964), which called for national unity against a common enemy and rebellion against the status quo.  The last section will focus on the production and reception of the 1986 CCTV television series Journey to the West, reached an unprecedented wide audience in China and beyond, having been re-broadcast more than 3000 times down to the present day.  With twenty-five episodes shot on location in many scenic parts of China, the cast and crew—recruited from various regional opera troupes, film studios and television stations—physically retraced the epic journey through iconic national landscapes and borderlands as well as reinvented its aesthetic traditions in a new popular medium.  I will conclude with some reflections on the series’ reverberations through different generations, ethnicities, diasporic communities and aesthetic afterlives."

				"description": "In October 2009, China added the Manas epic to UNESCO's list of intangible heritage in need of urgent safeguard on behalf of China's Kyrgyz minority. Neighbor Kyrgyzstan -- where a UNESCO-endorsed pageant to celebrate the epic as national heritage had been held in 1995 --  met the news with dismay and uproar. Ensuing debates on the meaning of tradition and the ownership of the epic revealed that motivations for transcribing the epic and the transcription practices differed, although in both cases the idea of salvaging an oral tradition from its imminent disappearance was paramount. On the side of Kyrgyzstan, written or sound records of the epic have been produced and preserved as acknowledgement or recognition of the artfulness of individual bards, and as evidence of the continuity or popularity of the tradition. On the side of China, a small team of scholars has repeatedly transcribed and re-transcribed the epic as performed by a single bard over a period of several decades in an attempt to canonize the tradition. Whether in Kyrgyzstan or in China, transcripts of the epic lay buried under dust for years until official institutions ‘transvalued’ them as ‘archives’ in the wake of UNESCO’s call to claim and protect intangible heritage. In this process of transvaluation, archival transcripts of the epic became valuable as tokens of state ownership, erasing the stories of their production. Yet, on both sides of the border, public memory keeps alive these stories and the experiences of suffering, coercion, subjection, and dispossession that they tell. This chapter examines how the value and meanings of Manas as a national epic are constructed and negotiated globally, transnationally, and locally."

				"description": "In 1791, the German philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder claimed that the Hungarian language would be forgotten in a few hundred years. It was an offhanded remark, just one sentence in many hundreds of pages. Yet Hungarians quoted it many times, and for a long time. On the one hand, they did not feel secure about the status of their language and culture in Central Europe, fearing the kind of assimilation that they had recently imposed upon other peoples. On the other hand, it was during this period that it became clear that their language was of Finno-Ugric origin, so their old stories of origin were cast into doubt. There was thus much debate in the nineteenth century about whether it were possible to create a national epic that was genuinely rooted in folk tradition, expressing the cultural strength of the modern Hungarian nation. My chapter centers on two attempts to create such an imagined Hungarian community. Following Virgil, Mihály Vörösmarty placed the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin in a mythological framework (Zalán's Flight, 1825); in contrast, János Arany wrote in his national epic that whichever nation breaks with the innocency of its mythological era is doomed to failure (The Death of Buda, 1863)."

				"description": "In The Flyting of Dunbar and Kennedie (c.1500-05), William Dunbar refers to his rival as an “Iersche brybour baird”, loosely translated as a 'Gaelic vagabond rhymer!' The stream of invective unleashed in this poetic battle of insults is both striking and revealing. Dunbar’s dismissive references to his opponent’s Gaelic heritage (Kennedy was from Carrick in South Ayrshire, at that time still Gaelic-speaking, and his mother was countess of Angus), in which he characterises Highlanders as filthy, poor, and thieving, emphasises for the modern reader the complexities of defining 'Scottishness.' For the border is not just with England – even that marker of national difference is a shifting, moveable line. Scottish borders can be real and imagined, linguistic and cultural; they mark the distinction between island and mainland, lowlands and highlands, Catholic and Protestant. This chapter examines the complexities of formulating a national identity in a country where national loyalties compete against local and regional relationships. Long poetic narratives like Barbour’s The Bruce (c. 1375) and Hary’s The Wallace (c. 1477) (both continuing to circulate in manuscript and print in the 16th century) speak to a Scottishness that seems firmly rooted in Anglo-Scots hostility, but the reality is inevitably more nuanced. This chapter traces developing depictions of Scottishness in literary texts and chronicles, from the Scots origin myth of Scota and Gathalos, to medieval depictions of national heroes like Wallace and Bruce, to Walter Scott’s depictions of the Highlands in the 19th century. The rise of political nationalism and the independence movement in the 20th century, the introduction of a devolved parliament, and SNP dominance of the Scottish political landscape add further dimensions to modern perceptions of what it is to be Scottish. The reality remains multifaceted and at times contradictory, features that continue to be reflected and shaped by the nation’s literature. "

				"description": "The Kǝbrä Nägäśt  (‘Glory of Kings’) was the foundational myth of the Solomonic Dynasty, which ruled the Christian kingdom of Ethiopia between 1270-1974 CE. This national epic is a tale of curiosity, faith, and patriotism; it rewrites Old Testament and Late Antique history on a grand scale. Expanding the biblical story of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba by the birth of a son, it propagates the Solomonic kings as the genealogical and spiritual heirs of the biblical Israelite and late antique Aksumite kingdoms. The text tells how the true Ark of the Covenant was transferred from Jerusalem to the Horn of Africa by Solomon’s Ethiopian son, Mǝnilǝk — but also how, in the 6th century, the Ethiopian king and Byzantine emperor divided the world between them. According to the Kǝbrä Nägäśt, Ethiopia — Ityop̣ya — was the new chosen land of Christianity, the noblest Christian kingdom on earth. Although the text’s colophon proclaims it to be a much older text, originally written in Coptic and Arabic, no such original has been found. A Coptic predecessor is now regarded as fictitious. Recent scholarship believes that the text was translated into the ancient Ethiopian language of Gǝʿǝz by the 1320s. Its importance to Ethiopian Christian self-image and state-image endured over time: the 1955 Ethiopian constitution drew on the Kǝbrä Nägäśt and declared the modern emperors of Ethiopia to be descendants of the Queen of Sheba and Solomon. Beliefs propagated in the Kǝbrä Nägäśt and concomitant visions of Ethiopian exceptionalism guided the policies and actions of political and religious leaders through the centuries, from 15th-century diplomacy to the Ethiopian victory against Italian colonizing forces of Adwa in 1896. Beyond its place in Ethiopian state rituals and law until 1974, the Kǝbrä Nägäśt still ranks among the most valuable texts Christian Ethiopians draw from to describe their place in the world, their conception of history, and their everyday, lived realities.

				"description": "Until the 18th century, Wales’s predominant national myth was one of dispossession and survival in the face of an implacable enemy, the Saxons. The story of lost sovereignty over the island of Britain and the determination of the Welsh to reclaim their homeland is told repeatedly in texts written in Welsh and Latin, ranging from the 10th-century prophecy Armes Prydein, ‘The Prophecy of Britain’, to Geoffrey of Monmouth’s Historia regum Britanniae of c. 1136. The most resonant examples of 'Welsh national epic' in the Middle Ages are the long poem, Y Gododdin, commemorating British losses against the Saxons, and the eleven prose tales of The Mabinogion which construct, variously, the survival of the Welsh against Norman incursions. The 18th and 19th centuries saw revival of antiquarian interest in the earliest Welsh manuscripts, with the first printed editions and translations appearing in London, and the antiquity of Y Gododdin and other texts attributed to Taliesin debated at length. The mid-19th-century translation of The Mabinogion by Lady Charlotte Guest interpellated new generations of readers in industrialized Wales who identified as Welsh but often did not speak or read Welsh. The reception of the national myth of British loss now began to focus on language loss as part of a teleological process of anglicisation. In the mid 20th century, modernist texts in Welsh and English by writers including Saunders Lewis and David Jones reimagined the Brythonic and Arthurian past as metaphors of linguistic and cultural survival. But as the dream of self-determination for Wales finally took shape as political devolution, the literary mood changed again. New retellings of ancient epic struggles emerged out of the defensive ruralism of the early 20th century into a confident substate nationalism; tales from the Mabinogion could be retold as parables of diversity and internationalism."

				"description": "Saveros Pou has brought to light the central position of the Rāmakerti in the court society of the ‘Middle Period.’ Studying that period, which corresponds to our premodern era, she has discovered sixteenth- and seventeenth-century manuscript sources that contain the first substantial written trace of the Cambodian version of the Indian epic Rāmāyaṇa. This text, which may be akin to a libretto, was put to a singular use: as a psalmodic accompaniment to the palace dancers, these stanzas, which have become a classic of Cambodian literature, participated in a royal eulogy that was intended to repair the dereliction of a world caught in the grip (it was believed) of chaos. Theatrically evoking the third age of the world (the dvāparayug, during which, according to the epic, Rāma, avatār of Viṣṇu, savior of all men who deserve salvation, is incarnated here on earth), the dancers exalted the glorious aspect of the reigning monarch, made one with Rāma, at once cakravartin king and boddhisattva, battling against the dark forces of Rāvaṇa, the demon king of Laṅkā, to spread the truth of Buddhism. In donning the masks and costumes of Rāma, Sītā, Rāvaṇa, or Hanumān on the occasions of royal ceremonies (enthronement, royal funerals, etc.), these dancers were not actors representing the golden age of a triumphant Buddhism associated with the ‘glory of Rāma’ (which is the meaning of the word Rāmakerti) but rather priestesses officiating at a religious celebration. There is every reason to believe that the divinity they summoned to sanctify the glory of the king was Umā, the consort of Śiva, who had long been charged with the protection of the realm. This was, in effect, one of many reconfigurations of the tutelar deity of the Angkor dynasty, the famous Devarāja."

				"description": "In this chapter, I establish St. Lucia’s national epic as its story of coming into artistic being in the face of innumerable colonial setbacks. At the heart of this exploration is a calibration of epicity that is the sum of the efforts of the poet and playwright, Derek Walcott; the dramatist, Roderick Walcott; the painter, Dunstan St. Omer; and the novelist, Garth St. Omer.  The creative activities of this quartet of St. Lucian artists go beyond the literary. Accordingly, my focus is on the wide-ranging artistic endeavors of these four men as they brought St. Lucia’s social, cultural, and natural landscape into focus. I argue that in their creative processes, they repurposed the topoi of the epic to suit an emergent national imaginary. Drawing inspiration from the island as muse—the land, the sea and the people—these Creatives harmonized a praisesong of their island.  Their polyvocal composition not only resonated deeply with a local audience, but also allowed St. Lucia—dubbed ‘Helen of the West’ for its incomparable beauty—to gain international acclaim, and to partake of the epic grandeur of the famed Helen of Troy. Sampling the pre-Independence creative works of this quartet, the chapter compares the strengths and successes of the different genres within which they were working.  Moreover, I explore how, in entering into aesthetic conversation with each other, the Walcott brothers and the St. Omer cousins were consciously and unconsciously theorizing the contribution of the artist to national history and values. I conclude by showing how these men, all active members of the now-defunct St. Lucia Arts Guild, formed a sustaining community that allowed for continued artistic growth and the propagation of deep intertextual influences.  Their legacies continue to enrich the island’s creative enterprises and allow for the ongoing composition of a national epic."

				"description": "The twin-island nation Trinidad and Tobago achieved independence from British colonial rule in 1962 and became a Republic in 1976.  Although small in geographical size, the country almost paradoxically requires the prefix “multi-” as a descriptor of its racial, ethnic, cultural, religious, and linguistic diversity due to the legacies of slavery, indentureship, and the migration of peoples from Europe, Asia, other Caribbean islands, and regions of the Americas to its shores. The southernmost island in the Caribbean, and just seven miles from Venezuela, Trinidad’s demographic trends continue to be influenced by this South American country. Home to the pitch lake, one of the seven wonders of the world, re-discovered by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1595 and immortalized, too, in the title of Trinidadian Alfred H. Mendes’s novel Pitch Lake (1934), Trinidad relies more on its petrochemicals than its tourism industry-- unlike Tobago and most of its Caribbean neighbors. In addition, there is a complex economic and sociopolitical history of having changed hands among the Spanish, French, and British during the days of European colonization—with Tobago also having experienced such attempts by the Swedes and the Dutch. Therefore, the islands have since the days of colonialism and political independence been charting and celebrating their own unique sense of national identities and forms of artistic expression even amid the throes of racism and racial politics, classism, colorism, neocolonialism, and other isms and schisms that are legacies of the past.  Its creative writers—emerging, contemporary, and canonical— among them the late Trinidad-born Nobel Laureate V.S Naipaul, have variously represented the triumphs and failures of these pre- and postcolonial conditions and environments in ‘epic’ literatures—in prose, poetic, and dramatic forms—which have contributed to the canonization of both the Trinidad and Tobago and Caribbean literary traditions."

				"description": "Ukrainian literature is in the special but not unique position of having two poems perform the role of national epic.  Traditionally, that role was assigned to Ivan Korliarevs’kyi’s  (1769-1838) poem Eneiida.  Published in 1798 as a travesty of Vergil’s Aeneid, it introduced Ukrainian literature in the vernacular.  Kotliarevskyi’s role as ‘father’ of the literature was assured even though the poem’s complete version appeared only posthumously in 1842. It was a huge success.  While recasting the Aeneid in burlesque terms it served as a comic encyclopedia of Ukrainian country life and customs, depicting peasantry and petty gentry and fondly revisiting old Cossack traditions.  The destruction of the Cossack stronghold of the Sitch in 1775 by Catherine II and the abolition of Ukrainian autonomy were reprised for his readers as the fall of Troy, and the wanderings of Aeneas brought Ukraine back not as political fact but as literary trope.    The burlesque poetics, however, also implied rustic innocence and simplicity and a tacit acceptance of provincial status in the Russian Empire.   By the Romantic period both the ideas and the burlesque poetics no longer rang true.  In the 1840s the literary scene was dominated by the national poet, Taras Shevchenko (1814-1861).  His early poem Haidamaky also appeared in 1842.  Part epic, part drama and lyrical meditation, it evoked a bloody 18th c. peasant uprising against the Polish gentry in a brooding and Byronic idiom that mesmerized his Ukrainian audience and was broadly discussed in Russian and Polish criticism. Its irony was utterly contemporary, and so were its complex narrative form and the poet’s anguish at having to revisit scenes of carnage in order to resurrect a sense of identity. Its focus on collective memory and on national liberation through ordeal and sacrifice are archetypal and resonate to this day."

				"description": "In 1889, the small kingdom of Serbia, having regained its independence from the four centuries long Ottoman rule barely a decade earlier, celebrated a great anniversary: five hundred years since the Battle of Kosovo (28 June 1389). Young King Aleksandar Obrenović joined state dignitaries in the old mediaeval capital of Kruševac to lay a foundation stone for a monument commemorating the battle. Its grandeur, heavily influenced by fashionable French academicism, departed significantly from the architecture of an Oriental kasaba, predominant in Serbian towns and cities during the Ottoman period. Depicting the most poignant verse from the Kosovo Cycle of Serbian epic poetry which so fascinated scholars in the early 19th century, the monument indicated the path chosen by the elites for state rebuilding. The epic poetry of the Kosovo Cycle, which formed the core of unifying, national narrative among the Serbs, dropped deep roots into the past, spanning the centuries between the doomed battle and the 19th-century present, borrowing from historical records, echoes from chroniclers, and abundant folk poetry, weaving a myth that still endures. Its full poetic glory, described by Jacob Grimm as 'an example of a clean and noble language without any narration gaps,' was finally codified in the late 18th and early 19th centuries by Vuk Stefanović Karadžić (1787-1864) and his followers. However, the turbulent 20th century brought many attempts to alter the myth and alter the sense of national self through political (mis)interpretation. This chapter will discuss how aggressive political agendas distort traditional materials, undermining the self-understanding of a national culture."

				"description": "Luís de Camões’s Os Lusíadas has resided at the center of Portugal’s literary canon since its publication in 1572. The voyage of Vasco da Gama from Portugal to India and back in 1497-99 is the historical backbone of the poem, with Gama’s arrival on the subcontinent traditionally viewed as an epic “achievement” in what is informally known as the “heroes of the sea” line of interpretation. The encounters of Gama and his crew with native Africans and Muslims (generally referred to categorically with the overarching and culturally blind label of “Moors”) along the entirely maritime route to India, the recitation of Portuguese history (distant and recent) with non-Christian peoples in a register of triumphant Christianity, and the telos of an eventual presence of Portugal around the globe are all facets of the poem that readers who wish to understand Os Lusíadas as a defense of Christian imperialism enlist in traditional, heroic interpretations of the poem. While Camões undeniably tells Gama’s and Portugal’s story in a celebratory key and consolidates Portugal’s identity as a seafaring nation (with its greatest epic achievement in the logic of the poem being the practice of high-seas navigation to the four corners of the earth), the poem also registers doubts and uncertainties about the imperial enterprise and Portugal’s preeminence on the global stage. This chapter charts readings and uses of the poem across the centuries that include interpretations that work against the traditional heroic understanding of the poem, and examines how Camões’s epic has been recruited to the realities and cultures of a diasporic and postcolonial world, including its survival in modern translations. It suggests that the criticisms of empire embedded in the poem point to later readings that transcend, reject, or overturn the imperial enterprise."

				"description": "José Rizal was executed by the Spanish colonial powers largely for his Spanish-language novel Noli Me Tangere (1887), which had helped to inspire the Philippine Revolution of 1896. Katipunero revolutionaries reportedly kept copies tucked into their pockets, and as recently as 1960, Philippine jurisprudence applied the ‘Maria Clara Doctrine,’ a reference to Rizal’s heroine, in cases of rape. The 1956 Rizal Law (Republic Act No. 1425) mandated that all public and private schools, colleges and universities should include courses on the life, works, and writings of the national hero, particularly the novel Noli Me Tangere and its sequel El Filibusterismo. This required novel is matched only, and only distantly, in the national literary and public imaginary by Francisco Baltazar’s Tagalog epic awit poem Florante at Laura (1838), set in Albania and Turkey. The preeminent classic of Tagalog poetry, Noli Me Tangere itself references it when the wise man Tasio muses: “Mahusay na makata at mahusay mag-isip si Baltazar” (Baltazar is a great poet and thinker). This chapter on Philippine national epics will study the production and circulation of Noli Me Tangere under four flags: Spanish, American, Japanese, and Filipino. We will explain the key place that Noli Me Tangere occupies in theorizing nationalism, on the one hand, and world literature, on the other, particularly the novel. It will show the production and circulation of Rizal's text as key to imagining the Philippine epic of nationalism, with a contrast to Baltazar and Florante at Laura, amounting to the triumph of the novel over poetry in narrativizing nationalism. We will also interrogate the two national epics by analyzing their respective aesthetics and politics of love, as they relate to theorizations of the nation-state, the affect of nationalism, and the process of nationalizing writ large."

				"description":"Is there still something we could call a Norwegian national epic? And what would qualify as ‘Norwegian national’? Should we delimit ourselves to works emerging after Norwegian independence from Denmark in 1814? In that case, there are certainly ‘great’ literary works that spring to mind. Starting in our own times, we might consider Karl Ove Knausgård’s Min kamp, with its endless stream of trivial, everyday detail, a quintessential expression of (post)modern Scandinavian life. There are not many historical novels to pick from, but Sigrid Undset’s Kristin Lavransdatter (1920–22) would be a candidate. Among the works of Henrik Ibsen, Norway’s first and still most prominent contribution to world literature, the verse drama Peer Gynt (1867) is often depicted as particularly ‘national’. From the nineteenth century we would also have to consider the folklore collected and published in the heydays of National Romanticism, foremost the fairy tales and medieval ballads. However, taking a broader historical perspective, it is hard to come up with anything whose Wirkungsgeschichte and continued influence can compare to Snorre Sturlason’s sagas of the medieval kings of Norway, Heimskringla, written in the early thirteenth century. That would leave us in the awkward position of appropriating a work written in Icelandic, by an Icelander, in Iceland as ‘Norwegian’. At the same time, however, it will allow us to untangle a not at all unique history of the heteronomous genealogy of the national. The history of Heimskringla is a history of migration and empire, language loss and translations, of changing systems of cultural circulation, of conflicts between Nordic hegemonial ambitions and nation state aspirations, of endless retranslations, rewritings, remediations and reappropriations."

				"description": "Of all the nations of Africa, Nigeria is arguably the most closely associated with literary production. From a global perspective,  this literariness is enshrined in the figures of Chinua Achebe, the acclaimed ‘father of modern African literature,’ author of  the most widely-read African novel, Things Fall Apart (1958) and of one of the most controversial critical essays of the twentieth century, 'An Image of Africa: Racism in Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness,' and Wole Soyinka, the first African to win a Nobel Prize for Literature (1986), whose variegated work is infused with epical, nation-making allure. In recent years, such writers as Ben Okri and Chimamanda Adichie have come to signify Nigerian literary prowess in the world republic of letters. Their work, however, has unleashed less revolutionary power than that of their predecessors, whose oeuvre is reflective not just of the tides of history, but of their own subjectivities as intellectuals and historical actors. In Nigeria itself, however, validation of these writers and their work intersects with a more complex sense of literariness, inextricable from Nigeria’s sense of self as a nation. Beyond some of the acclaimed works by world-renowned writers, the body of writing taken to be indicative of national character heavily features texts that do not circulate globally. This chapter explores the fraught relationship between what the world considers Nigerian epics and their configuration in the country itself. It pays close attention to aesthetic nuances and historical contingencies, and to the role of literature syllabi and mass and social media in shaping Nigerian national epics (and so problematizing widely-held notions about Nigerian writing). It will make a case for what the scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. defines as the ‘Talmudic’ role of scholars in the resurrection, preservation, and the projection of the country’s less-known national epics onto the world stage."

				"caption":"Petar Petrović Njegoš II and his mausoleum atop Mount Lovćen",
				"description": "When Petar Petrović Njegoš II, the Prince-Bishop of Montenegro, died in Cetinje in 1851 aged only 37, the mausoleum he had designed and begun building atop Mount Lovćen a few years earlier was still not complete. Literary romanticism was in full bloom among the Balkan Christians. The monumental epic poem of Njegoš known as The Mountain Wreath reworked traditional poems of the Kosovo Cycle (which centered on the famous battle of 1389).   Published in 1847, Njegoš's poem spoke to the struggle against the Ottoman rule which engulfed the Balkans since the early 1800s. The epic's dedication  evokes the chief generals of the Napoleonic era as ‘offspring of Bellona’ but above them all Njegoš puts Karađorđe, leader of the First Serbian Uprising (1804-1813). Thus Njegoš’s dying wish that, from his final resting place, he might ‘oversee all Serbian lands’ symbolically married the sense of national selfhood among highlanders of Montenegro with that of other Serbs. Until World War I, Njegoš laid undisturbed in his chapel, overseeing the liberation and growth of Montenegro. In 1916, however, the occupying Austro-Hungarian authorities raised the chapel to the ground, while Njegoš’s remains were transferred to the Monastery of Cetinje. Restored in 1925, the church once again received the Prince-Bishop. But not for long. After World War II, the new communist authorities, aiming at containing the Serbs within Yugoslavia, proclaimed the Montenegrins a separate nation and ordered demolition of Njegoš’s chapel. Yet another new mausoleum was built in 1974, but this directly contradicted Njegoš’s will by making no reference to his status within the Serbian Orthodox Church. The 1990s brought new insurgencies, new wars, and new interpretations of  The Mountain Wreath, rendering the status of Njegoš as an epic national poet once again uncertain."

				"description": "Ngugi wa Thiong’o’s recent Kenda Mūiyūru, (The Perfect Nine), is rooted in the orature that Ngugi has championed in the last several decades. It relates a Gikuyu myth of origin that Jomo Kenyatta wrote about in Facing Mount Kenya. The dominance of the Gikuyu in political life in Kenya has contributed to the cultural capital of the myth. Paradoxically, Ngugi’s treatment of the myth in the form of epic written in Gikuyu makes it both a more idiomatically Gikuyu myth and an epic about world building, and therefore belonging to the lineage of classical European philosophical epics. The English version uses recognizably Virgilian and Homeric tropes, but also echoes philosophical cosmogonies like those of Lucretius and Bernardus Silvestris. Earlier epic forms on the Swahili coast are implicated in an older and even more complex cultural and political tradition. They are the product of a millennium-long interaction between the east coast of Africa and centers of rule across the Red Sea. A rich literary culture on the islands of Lamu and Pate shapes epics such as the eighteenth-century Utendi wa Tambuka, an account of the theological and military conflict between Muslims and the Byzantines. A more philosophical poem, informed by Sufi asceticism, the Al-Inkishafi, by the poet and theologian Sayyid Abdallah, anticipates the fall of Pate. It becomes the armature of a number of later Swahili works written in—and about—post-independence Tanzania. The 2019 novel The Dragonfly Sea by Yvonne Owuor Adhiambo returns to a modern Pate, now a neglected backwater. Adhiambo excavates a history that places Pate at the center of a premodern geopolitics centered on China, but sutures this together with a present in which geopolitical interests in Kenya are once again shifting toward China."

				"description": "For Germans, the national epic remains a vexed question. Before 1945, the medieval Nibelungenlied would have been the obvious candidate. But because of the poem’s major role both in imperial Germany’s and, even more so, in the Nazis’ nationalist propaganda, the text became irredeemably tarnished in the capacity of a ‘national epic’. Besides, the poem’s tradition as national epic was a fairly recent one, a product of nineteenth-century German philology’s attempt to provide ideological legitimacy for the nation state established in 1871. Thus, after World War II, more recent literary artefacts began unofficially to jostle for the role of encapsulating Germany’s cultural and historical identity. Divided along the faultlines of the Cold War, the two German states succeeding the Reich, each in its own specific way, had to deal with the legacies of defeat, tyranny and genocide. In both states, the ideal of nationhood was frequently downplayed or even rejected, and hence texts were privileged that focused on regional identities, on bourgeois cultural traditions, served as allegories of the Nazi era or deliberately promoted the identity of the GDR as a socialist nation. From 1990 onwards, the unexpected unification of the two Germanies raised the problem of national identity in new and unprecedented ways. The reluctance as well as ironic fatalism felt by many Germans vis à vis the return of the nation state is perhaps best expressed in Wolfgang Becker’s 2003 movie Good Bye Lenin which, for all its humour, conceives of the national experience in terms of profound melancholy. Paying attention to the issues and phenomena sketched above, this contribution gauges the degree to which, given the country’s twentieth-century history, the very notion of a national epic can still be possible within a German context."

				"description": "The Knight in the Panther’s Skin by Shota Rustaveli (c. 1160- c. 1220), the book most loved by Georgians, is revered by some as highly as the Bible or the Constitution. There are about 140 manuscripts of the poem, which over the centuries has been endlessly and variously adapted and translated into more than 50 languages. Brides still receive a copy with their dowry. Despite numerous attempts at erasure, by friend or foe, it still holds a place of distinction in the Georgian polyphonic cultural genome, and is truly sui generis. The architectonics of the poem are largely complete, and its individual parts lie in pleasing proportion to the main body. In a style uncommon to his contemporaries, Rustaveli adroitly manages individual and typological features of his characters. Balancing poetic fantasy against objective representation, he shows realistic understanding of worldly affairs. While defining and expanding its geography into stories of Arabia and India, the poem clearly engages with the socio-political and economic conditions in the kingdom of Georgia. Taken to mark the onset of a  Georgian Golden Age, the poem is regarded as an “unset pearl,” and has never lost curricular relevance in schools or universities. Its literary style and original language are still comprehensible in today’s diverse classrooms as well as university auditoria, and the pandemic has prompted online teaching of the poem through <a href='https://1tv.ge/video/qartuli-abiturientis-dro-didi-wignebi-vefkhistyaosani-teleskola/'>TV-School</a>. But where does Rustaveli come from? His poem is deeply rooted in Georgian language, culture, folklore, and fundamental obligations of hospitality. This chapter will examine Rustaveli’s poem from its points of origination, through myriad adaptations and into its remarkable socio-cultural relevance in the nation of Georgia today."

				"description": "Subverting the classicist project of national epic-making by placing gods and epic heroes in everyday environments with workaday speech, the genre of travesties or mock epics came to the Slavic lands via the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century West European literary tradition. The Aeneid Turned Inside Out [Eneida navyvarat] is a Belarusian burlesque poem dating from the 1820s. Written by an anonymous author and imitative in nature, it is considered today to be a founding text of the Belarusian national literary tradition (as one of the first secular works written in the Belarusian vernacular to be widely circulated). This chapter discusses the impact of this text on the development of Belarusian literary language as the first articulations of national consciousness. It does this by comparing The Aeneid Turned Inside Out to both its Russian and Ukrainian sources, and the Belarusian texts that followed. The two direct Slavic literary sources for this poem are the Russian travesty by Nikolai Osipov and Alexander Kotelnitsky titled Vergil’s Aeneid Turned Inside Out (1791–1796), and Ukrainian The Aeneid. Transposed into the Little Russian Language by I. Kotliarevs′kyi (1798, 1808). Another point of comparison is Taras on Mount Parnassus [Taras an Parnase] (1851; 1889), a later Belarusian mock epic attributed to Kanstantsin Veranitsyn. The chapter concludes by showing how critical reception of The Aeneid Turned Inside Out became a site for negotiating national identity for generations of later readers."

				"description": "Voltaire, while exiled in London for attacking the French monarchy, discovered Milton's Paradise Lost, Shakespeare’s plays, and a democratic society where the epic, whether in straight or parodic form (Pope, The Rape of the Lock) was one of the most fruitful modes of literature. Voltaire had already tried his hand at epic form in composing his Henriad, extolling Henri IV, a Protestant who converted to Catholicism to bring the Wars of Religion to an end. But the Henriad, while enjoying some success, failed to mark a new departure for the epic genre in France. 'The French,' concluded a disappointed Voltaire, 'have no head for epic (Les Français n’ont pas tête épique).  His fateful dictum has been treated as gospel, more or less, ever since. But the French revolution, and the Napoleonic wars in its wake, would give Voltaire's prediction the lie. If the French had no head for epic, what about French feet in revolutionary crowds, and the Grande Armée, marching out across the continent? The question of epic would indeed come alive again with the rising European nationalisms of the XIXth century, obliging France to search for a lost 'national epic.' But where was it to be found?"

				"description": "The Mahābhārata (“The Great Story of the Bhāratas”) is the monumental national epic of India, even though the other great epic Rāmāyaṇa complements its significance for contemporary Indians, especially Hindus.  More than 2500 years old, the epic continues to serve as both an analogical and allegorical template to delineate historical, social, political, and ethical changes during epochal crisis points punctuated by transforming ideas about nationhood.  This chapter will accordingly trace the formation and reformation of Indian nations as epiphenomena of a transforming range of epic readings.  Some argue that the original epic underwrites for the imperial Mauryas (200-400 BCE) a mythic conception of Bhāratavarṣa or Bhārata, an enduring name for the Indian nation (as enshrined in the 1948 Constitution: “India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States.”)  In the late colonial period, the Mahābhārata served to define fault lines between Indian nationalists and the British Raj, mapping the epic theme of restoring stolen lands to their rightful heirs (now represented by the Indian Independence movement).  Chakravarti Rajagopalachari, the last Governor-General of India and English translator of both Sanskrit epics, captures a nationalist mood in prefacing his Rāmāyaṇa translation: “The real need of the hour is a re-communion between us and the sages of our land ... Our classics really embody our national character in all its aspects and it is well the world sees us as we really are, apart from what we wish to become… [The epics] bind our vast numbers together as one people, despite caste, space and language that seemingly divide them.”  The Mahābhārata still today satisfies traditional acculturative needs, but is also frequently repurposed by diverse communities to contest those very nationalist formulations that it helped define a few generations earlier."

				"description": "If a national epic may be defined as a narrative that tells the story of a people in a land that they consider their own, and their struggles against those who challenge their claim to that land, then the Shahnameh may be considered Iran’s national epic. Two features of the Shahnameh justify this characterization. First, its narrative remains available to Persian speakers because literary Persian has changed little over the past millennium. Second, it is neither the story of an individual nor a heroic clan but the tale of Iran and the Iranian people. Unlike European epics that were rediscovered and put to use in nationalist projects quite recently, a literary form of Iran’s heroic traditions has been the focal point of national identity since the 4th century BC. This tradition was adopted by Muslim historians of the 7th century AD, who incorporated it into their narratives in Arabic. The rise of literary Persian in the 9th century led to the creation of a massive prose story of Iran from the first primordial king to the Arab conquest. This was commissioned by an Iranian aristocrat and was completed in April of 957 AD by a team of scholars. Ferdowsi’s Shahnameh—completed in 1010 AD—is a versification of this prose original.  The poem and its poet have been cultural icons since the 12th century. With the rise of modern nationalism in Iran and the renovation of Ferdowsi’s mausoleum (built between 1928-1934, remodeled in 1969) Iranians flock to his tomb during national holidays.  This chapter examines the significance and impact of Iran’s epic tradition on the country’s national consciousness."

				"description": "When Britain annexed Aotearoa/New Zealand in 1840, Aotearoa’s tangata whenua (indigenous Maori peoples) conceived of identity in terms of iwi (tribal) rather than national affiliation. By the time of Aotearoa/New Zealand’s sesquicentenary, many Maori still embraced the notion of ‘many different nations which make up the indigenous population of Aotearoa’ (Rika-Heke 1997: 171-2). However, the experience of colonisation did prompt Aotearoa’s indigenous peoples to develop a new sense of themselves as a constituency of Maori (one meaning of this word is ‘normal’) in relation to the tauiwi (British settlers), who were given the name ‘Pakeha’ as a way of distinguishing between the outsiders and the tangata whenua. This binary has profoundly inflected national(ist) discourses and literatures that developed in Aotearoa/New Zealand, enduring into the present alongside other strands added by the multiple ethnic communities that migrated to Aotearoa/New Zealand during and beyond the 19th century. This chapter explores the work of key authors of multiple ethnicities who have produced what may be termed national ‘epics’, or explorations of cultural and literary nationalism, since the late 19th century, when Pakeha authors began developing literary models that moved away from British exemplars towards local specificities (which I will also trace through the works of Katherine Mansfield). I will also explore the literary/cultural nationalist movement of the 1930s (spearheaded by Pakeha authors such as Allen Curnow, A.R.D. Fairburn and Frank Sargeson), with reference to the work of female authors (such as Janet Frame and Robin Hyde) marginalised by the masculinist bias of this movement, before considering a range of work by Maori authors (including Witi Ihimaera and Patricia Grace) and writers of Asian and Pacific descent (including Selina Tusitala Marsh, Albert Wendt and Alison Wong) who have contested dominant Pakeha perspectives in producing their own reflections upon Aotearoa/New Zealand as a multi-ethnic nation."

				"description": "My chapter will bear out George Brandes’ claim, made in his 1903 “study of the land, people, and literature” of Poland, that in Adam Mickiewicz’s 1834 poem Pan Tadeusz “Poland possesses the only successful epic [the nineteenth] century has produced.” I first outline briefly the epic tradition in Polish literature, from Piotr Kochanowski’s 1618 translation of Tasso’s Gerusalemme Liberata to (the miscarried) efforts to produce a national epic according to classicist specifications. I then situate Pan Tadeusz within the tradition of Western foundational epics, epitomized by Vergil’s Aeneid, on the one hand; and the romantic horizon of expectations (as articulated above all by the Polish critic Maurycy Mochnacki) of what might constitute a national epic, on the other, with a view toward the Herderian—modern—concept of nation. As such, Pan Tadeusz constitutes a “social drama” (Victor Turner) that enacts the passage of an effete premodern society on the verge of extinction to a revitalized, nationally conscious collective. I conclude by arguing that the poem’s status as Poland’s national epic is as much a function of its reception by the immediate, post-romantic generation as it is by Mickiewicz’s epic intentions."

				"description": "'I could construct seven different Kalevalas from the poems I have collected so far', wrote the physician Elias Lönnrot (1802–1884) in 1848. While revolutions convulsed most of Europe, the Finnish intelligentsia concentrated on forging a collective identity from the former easternmost provinces of the Swedish kingdom. Publication of the Kalevala was key to this nation-building. This book of Finnish-language folk poems was from its first edition (1835; extended version 1849) honored as 'the national epic of the Finns'; one of the poorest, most scarcely-populated corners of North-Eastern Europe thus provided one of the most succesful national epics in the Europe of romantic nationalism. However, the Kalevalaic storyworld's decisive cultural breakthrough came only in the late nineteenth century, as the language of culture and learning, politics and economics changed from Swedish to Finnish. The 50 poems and almost 23000 verses of the Kalevala are set in the pagan past, and its narrative arches from an archaic creation myth to the arrival of Christianity. The Kalevala has inspired a wide variety of painters, architects, musicians and writers in Finland. Restaurants, insurance companies, banks, newspapers, icebreakers, items of jewellery, matchboxes and crispbread brands all carry names of Kalevalaic heroes. Generations of school kids have struggled with its trochaic metre and illustrated its poems in their art classes, although cother national narratives are now usurping its canonical role in school curricula. The book has been translated into more than 60 languages, inspiring, for example, H.W. Longfellow and J. R. R. Tolkien. Lately, ultra-nationalistic right-wing ”pseudohistories” have capitalized on its images of archaic Finnishness. So although the average Finn reads Lönnrot' s text less than ever, it it continues to permeate Finnish national culture of the 21st century."

				"description": "The turbulent first hundred years of the Greek State (1828-1923) were formative in developing a modern national identity. Major political and social upheavals led to extensive changes in the intellectual life of the young country. The Homeric epics formed part of the education of the Greek-speaking elite throughout the Byzantine empire, but the two long poems (very different in character and poetic style) never became national epics. Only after the formation of the Modern Greek state did the Homeric texts assume some national epic characteristics-- but they were read in translation, since their archaic poetic diction was incomprehensible for most readers. The discovery of vernacular redactions of the Byzantine Tale of Digenis Akritis in the later nineteenth century, and of associated folk-songs with Digenis as hero, suggested that this material belongs to an epic that could be called national. My chapter will examine various aspects of the presence of Homer and of the Digenis Akritis in Greece. Translations and popularizations of the ancient epics gained political charge around the turn of the 20th century, and the travails of Odysseus in the Odyssey served as a metaphor for the fate of Greek people over centuries as exiles and immigrants. Various adaptations of the Digenis were made for the stage in heroic or even comic guises. This chapter will include input from high-school students from Thessalonica who have been been taught Homer and the Digenis at school-- which leads us to question whether any text currently serves as “national epic” or even “anti-epic” as the country struggles to recover from the financial crisis of 2009 and the pandemic."

It was a cold day, yet the atmosphere was festive; people were dressed in their finest, children were lined up at the quay and fluttering flags were in abundance. The cause for celebration was the arrival of a coast guard ship from Denmark, bringing as its unusual cargo two medieval manuscripts to be delivered to the Icelandic nation as one of the earliest and unparalleled gestures of cultural offering and repatriation. The event marks in many ways the apex of a process of cultural identity-formation in Iceland; a consolidation of the past into a single symbolic narrative mediated in the textual manifestation of that past, that is the Íslendingasögur (the sagas of Icelanders) and the eddic poems. This chapter will elaborate on the process of self-realization and actualization of a national identity via literary history, more specifically through the cultural history provided by the sagas as a memorial to settlement, community-building, and cultural inheritance. It will discuss the role of the mythographical poems and the sagas as national epics and their role within literary history more broadly. Finally, it will contend with the vexed issue of national identity and belonging being affirmed through lineage and heritage and the frequently problematic appropriation and reformulation of literary history for such purposes."

				"description": "The classic Korean novel The Story of Hong Gildong narrates the adventures of the title character, an illegitimate son of a nobleman who leaves home to become the intrepid leader of outlaws who steal from the wealthy and punish the corrupt, and then leaves the country with his followers to become the ruler of his own island kingdom.  In modern Korea, it has become the best-known epic from traditional literature, often used to speak of the ingenuity, resilience, and dynamism of the Korean people.  Unfortunately, much of the scholarly understanding of the work itself has been marred by a series of historical myths concerning its production, in particular that it was written by an aristocratic writer in the early seventeenth century, inspired by the great Chinese bandit epic Water Margin.  In actuality, it appears to have been composed in the middle or late nineteenth century, when Joseon dynasty Korea was undergoing tremendous change and decline due to the pressures of modernity and foreign intervention.  There is evidence to show that The Story of Hong Gildong was a popular work at the time of its publication, but its rise as a kind of national epic did not occur until the modern era, through countless retellings in film, television, novels, and comic books.  In that sense, the Hong Gildong story that most Koreans are familiar with is largely a modern reinvention of the classic character, oftentimes serving specific political and cultural functions of the contemporary period.  This chapter examines the transformation of the figure from classic literature to its iconic status in the modern Korean imagination."

				"description": "Saxo’s History of the Danes (Gesta Danorum), finished around 1208, has all the credentials of a national epic: it is of venerable age, it is long (c. 750 pp), it makes grand claims for a small nation, it is written in artful prose and even includes extensive poems, it is heroic, it covers an impressive timespan. But for the romantic intellectuals it came with one fatal flaw: it was written in Latin. The book therefore never got even close to the status of the otherwise comparable Heimskringla in Norway or Nibelungen in Germany. In my chapter I will focus on the prolific romanticist decades c. 1800-1830 in which the new desire for a national epic text circled in frustration around Gesta Danorum and other texts – incl. Beowulf with its Danish setting. The main protagonist of my piece is the leading figure of N.F.S. Grundtvig (1783-1872), translator, author, national mobilizer, churchman and more, seconded by the popular author B.S. Ingemann (1789-1862) and scholars such as C. Molbech (1783-1857) and P.E. Müller (1776-1834). Their romantic aspirations for revitalizing the heritage of pagan or medieval Danish culture were sharpened by the national disasters following in the wake of Denmark’s siding with Napoleon: a national bankruptcy was declared in 1813, and the following year the monarchy lost Norway. The search for an epic produced much excellent literature and scholarship, but ultimately failed. Since then the Danish canon developed along multiple lines, but would never count a medieval classic as part of it. Perhaps new translations as well as global Latin and global English is about to get Saxo more readers than ever before."

				"description": "On the face of it, the story of William Tell, who retaliates for being forced to shoot an apple from his son’s head by assassinating the Habsburg governor, epitomises the desire of the Swiss for liberation from foreign oppressors. As with all national stories, however, Tell can mean different things to different constituencies. This chapter will initially survey the genesis of the story in the late fifteenth century at the time of Swiss independence from the Habsburgs, together with its early development in drama, lyric and chronicle, in particular, Aegidius Tschudi’s Chronicon Helveticum. It will then examine its successive appropriations, first by the French Revolution, and second by Schiller, whose play Wilhelm Tell (1804) promulgates romantic ideals of individual freedom and liberation distinct from self-interested political violence. By the mid-nineteenth century, in tune with their constitutionalisation, the Swiss seem to have decided to accept this German play as a mirror of their national identity, troping Schiller \"the German poet with the Swiss heart.\" The play continued in annual production throughout the twentieth century, ideologically divided between largescale, lay productions valorising a conservative vision of the nation, and art-house productions critiquing the potentially right-wing implications of its patriotism. Further important post-war responses include Max Frisch’s Wilhelm Tell für die Schule (1971), and the 2014 film, Schweizer helden, in which Schiller’s play is performed by asylum seekers.  However, some of the most thought-provoking revisions of Tell in the modern age are not textual but iconographic. Finally, this chapter will explore the images of Tell created by Richard Kissling (1895), and Ferdinand Hödler (1897), and their re-animation in twentieth-century Swiss political posters to support positions from the extreme left to the extreme right, along with the series of psychoanalytic William Tell paintings produced by Salvador Dali in the 1930s."

				"description": "The nation now known as Romania has a long and complex history. Indigenous peoples yield to Greek and Roman colonization, with Mongol and later Ottoman incursions resisted by Moldavian, Transylvanian, and Wallachian principalities. Architects of a cohesive Romanian identity drew from rich but multifarious materials in shaping novels and then state-sponsored films. National emergence is figured as an epic journey; Romania and the Republic of Moldova make different selections from overlapping sources. Maintenance of a nation-wide culture, as opposed to regional or ethnic self-identification, was a pressing concern for the Bucharest elites well into the 20th century. Novels, and later state-sponsored films, realized Romanian ethno-genesis through victories of ethnic Romanians on the battlefields of medieval Wallachia and Moldovia, or, reaching further back, Rome's conquest of Dacia . Films of this kind feature iconic Dacian kings or medieval princes as heroes of the nation, not as heroic individuals. From the later 19th century onwards, epic metaphors of Romanian self-definition ascribe ominous agency to the East (traditionally, to the Ottoman and the Russian Empires). Romania, from the backwaters of Eastern Europe, thus strives to align itself with the West, developing the grand narrative of a relatively new nation that prides itself on speaking one of the five major Romance languages-- uniquely, in Eastern Europe. Mihail Sadoveanu (1880-1961) and Nicolae Dabija (1948-2021) argued for the rights of Romanian nationals in contested borderlands, using the perceived clout of their native tongue (as a nation-building tool) and fictionalizing history. Sadoveanu, author of historically-themed novels adapted to the big screen, became a household name for Romanian-speaking audiences. Dabija, as a nationally-minded Romanian writer of the Republic of Moldova, shows how national identity might be actualized through Romanian literary culture in the post-Soviet republic."

				"description": "What is your national epic? Both terms are a challenge for Australia, a settler nation with origins in the history of British colonialism. Here and now, the thing that characterizes Australia as a nation is unresolved sovereignty, a latent sentiment that is growing fast and deeply felt. The sovereignty of white Australia is mainstream and dominant—including the English language enshrined in foundational documents like the Constitution—but also unstable, incomplete, and illegitimate for an increasing number of Australians. First nation Australians are asserting their claims to a sovereignty that was never ceded. ‘Always was, always will be Aboriginal land’ is a powerful dictum in public discourse. These shifts must inflect the idea of national epic. As elsewhere, the reality of the Australian nation is in process rather than resolved. There is no single Australian national epic. Candidates include Marcus Clarke’s convict novel For the Term of His Natural Life (1870-1872, 1874), Eleanor Dark’s trilogy of national settlement The Timeless Land (1941), James McAuley’s sectarian poem of maritime discovery Captain Quiros (1964) and Patrick White’s The Tree of Man (1955).  We will focus primarily on novels that, in containing history and envisioning nation, can be counted as epics. Henry Handel Richardson’s trilogy, The Fortunes of Richard Mahony (1930) and Alexis Wright’s Carpentaria (2006) trace an arc along which time, nation and history refract through life-stories of individually conceived but representative characters. These novels share formal aspects germane to the epical work of nation: each reworks the European and modern novel. Richardson reworks the structural achievements of the realist novel to historicize a nation through the tragic life of her protagonist while Wright reconceptualizes the magical realist novel’s form and language to write Aboriginal deep time."

				"description": "The island of Martinique (Martinican Matinik or Matnik) lies directly north of St Lucia and (further south) Trinidad. As a départemente of France, it is a special territory of the European union, and its currency is the euro. Almost everyone on the island speaks French and Martinican creole; the speaking of Kalinago, an Arawakan language, faded in the early twentieth century under intense colonialist pressure. Three of the most influential anti-colonialist writers of the region (or of any region) emerged from Martinique: Aimé Césaire (1913-2008), Franz Fanon (1925-1961), and Édouard Glissant (1928-2011). Texts such as Aimé Césaire's Cahier d'un retour au pays natal, (1939) and Fanon's The Wretched of the Earth (1961), and also the work of Glissant, contribute to and draw from the movement of négritude, which was also shaped and documented by women writers. Jeanne Nardal (1900-1993) and Paulette Nardal (1896-1985), theorized the movement and laid important connections with the Harlem Renaissance; Suzanne Césaire edited Tropiques, the most influential Francophone Caribbean journal. Édouard Glissant was shortlisted for the Noble Prize in 1992, when it was awarded an epical poet from the island fifty miles to the south: Derek Walcott (see 'St Lucia' chapter). Many major writers from Martinique were drawn to contemplation of wide, epical spaces: Glissant developed a notion of Antillanité, evoking a space stretching to Latin America, whereas Aimé Césaire emphasized African cathections. Landscapes of Martinican space remain of vital concern today, as writers ponder relations between poetry and ecology in light of what is now a distinguished, and highly influential, literary tradition."
