				"description": "My chapter will bear out George Brandes’ claim, made in his 1903 “study of the land, people, and literature” of Poland, that in Adam Mickiewicz’s 1834 poem Pan Tadeusz “Poland possesses the only successful epic [the nineteenth] century has produced.” I first outline briefly the epic tradition in Polish literature, from Piotr Kochanowski’s 1618 translation of Tasso’s Gerusalemme Liberata to (the miscarried) efforts to produce a national epic according to classicist specifications. I then situate Pan Tadeusz within the tradition of Western foundational epics, epitomized by Vergil’s Aeneid, on the one hand; and the romantic horizon of expectations (as articulated above all by the Polish critic Maurycy Mochnacki) of what might constitute a national epic, on the other, with a view toward the Herderian—modern—concept of nation. As such, Pan Tadeusz constitutes a “social drama” (Victor Turner) that enacts the passage of an effete premodern society on the verge of extinction to a revitalized, nationally conscious collective. I conclude by arguing that the poem’s status as Poland’s national epic is as much a function of its reception by the immediate, post-romantic generation as it is by Mickiewicz’s epic intentions."

				"description": "Subverting the classicist project of national epic-making by placing gods and epic heroes in everyday environments with workaday speech, the genre of travesties or mock epics came to the Slavic lands via the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century West European literary tradition. The Aeneid Turned Inside Out [Eneida navyvarat] is a Belarusian burlesque poem dating from the 1820s. Written by an anonymous author and imitative in nature, it is considered today to be a founding text of the Belarusian national literary tradition (as one of the first secular works written in the Belarusian vernacular to be widely circulated). This chapter discusses the impact of this text on the development of Belarusian literary language as the first articulations of national consciousness. It does this by comparing The Aeneid Turned Inside Out to both its Russian and Ukrainian sources, and the Belarusian texts that followed. The two direct Slavic literary sources for this poem are the Russian travesty by Nikolai Osipov and Alexander Kotelnitsky titled Vergil’s Aeneid Turned Inside Out (1791–1796), and Ukrainian The Aeneid. Transposed into the Little Russian Language by I. Kotliarevs′kyi (1798, 1808). Another point of comparison is Taras on Mount Parnassus [Taras an Parnase] (1851; 1889), a later Belarusian mock epic attributed to Kanstantsin Veranitsyn. The chapter concludes by showing how critical reception of The Aeneid Turned Inside Out became a site for negotiating national identity for generations of later readers."

				"description": "'I could construct seven different Kalevalas from the poems I have collected so far', wrote the physician Elias Lönnrot (1802–1884) in 1848. While revolutions convulsed most of Europe, the Finnish intelligentsia concentrated on forging a collective identity from the former easternmost provinces of the Swedish kingdom. Publication of the Kalevala was key to this nation-building. This book of Finnish-language folk poems was from its first edition (1835; extended version 1849) honored as 'the national epic of the Finns'; one of the poorest, most scarcely-populated corners of North-Eastern Europe thus provided one of the most succesful national epics in the Europe of romantic nationalism. However, the Kalevalaic storyworld's decisive cultural breakthrough came only in the late nineteenth century, as the language of culture and learning, politics and economics changed from Swedish to Finnish. The 50 poems and almost 23000 verses of the Kalevala are set in the pagan past, and its narrative arches from an archaic creation myth to the arrival of Christianity. The Kalevala has inspired a wide variety of painters, architects, musicians and writers in Finland. Restaurants, insurance companies, banks, newspapers, icebreakers, items of jewellery, matchboxes and crispbread brands all carry names of Kalevalaic heroes. Generations of school kids have struggled with its trochaic metre and illustrated its poems in their art classes, although cother national narratives are now usurping its canonical role in school curricula. The book has been translated into more than 60 languages, inspiring, for example, H.W. Longfellow and J. R. R. Tolkien. Lately, ultra-nationalistic right-wing ”pseudohistories” have capitalized on its images of archaic Finnishness. So although the average Finn reads Lönnrot' s text less than ever, it it continues to permeate Finnish national culture of the 21st century."

				"description": "The turbulent first hundred years of the Greek State (1828-1923) were formative in developing a modern national identity. Major political and social upheavals led to extensive changes in the intellectual life of the young country. The Homeric epics formed part of the education of the Greek-speaking elite throughout the Byzantine empire, but the two long poems (very different in character and poetic style) never became national epics. Only after the formation of the Modern Greek state did the Homeric texts assume some national epic characteristics-- but they were read in translation, since their archaic poetic diction was incomprehensible for most readers. The discovery of vernacular redactions of the Byzantine Tale of Digenis Akritis in the later nineteenth century, and of associated folk-songs with Digenis as hero, suggested that this material belongs to an epic that could be called national. My chapter will examine various aspects of the presence of Homer and of the Digenis Akritis in Greece. Translations and popularizations of the ancient epics gained political charge around the turn of the 20th century, and the travails of Odysseus in the Odyssey served as a metaphor for the fate of Greek people over centuries as exiles and immigrants. Various adaptations of the Digenis were made for the stage in heroic or even comic guises. This chapter will include input from high-school students from Thessalonica who have been been taught Homer and the Digenis at school-- which leads us to question whether any text currently serves as “national epic” or even “anti-epic” as the country struggles to recover from the financial crisis of 2009 and the pandemic."

				"description": "On April 21st, 1971, a large crowd of people gathered at the harbor in Reykjavík, Iceland. It was a cold day, yet the atmosphere was festive; people were dressed in their finest, children were lined up at the quay and fluttering flags were in abundance. The cause for celebration was the arrival of a coast guard ship from Denmark, bringing as its unusual cargo two medieval manuscripts to be delivered to the Icelandic nation as one of the earliest and unparalleled gestures of cultural offering and repatriation. The event marks in many ways the apex of a process of cultural identity-formation in Iceland; a consolidation of the past into a single symbolic narrative mediated in the textual manifestation of that past, that is the Íslendingasögur (the sagas of Icelanders) and the eddic poems. This chapter will elaborate on the process of self-realization and actualization of a national identity via literary history, more specifically through the cultural history provided by the sagas as a memorial to settlement, community-building, and cultural inheritance. It will discuss the role of the mythographical poems and the sagas as national epics and their role within literary history more broadly. Finally, it will contend with the vexed issue of national identity and belonging being affirmed through lineage and heritage and the frequently problematic appropriation and reformulation of literary history for such purposes."

				"description": "The classic Korean novel The Story of Hong Gildong narrates the adventures of the title character, an illegitimate son of a nobleman who leaves home to become the intrepid leader of outlaws who steal from the wealthy and punish the corrupt, and then leaves the country with his followers to become the ruler of his own island kingdom.  In modern Korea, it has become the best-known epic from traditional literature, often used to speak of the ingenuity, resilience, and dynamism of the Korean people.  Unfortunately, much of the scholarly understanding of the work itself has been marred by a series of historical myths concerning its production, in particular that it was written by an aristocratic writer in the early seventeenth century, inspired by the great Chinese bandit epic Water Margin.  In actuality, it appears to have been composed in the middle or late nineteenth century, when Joseon dynasty Korea was undergoing tremendous change and decline due to the pressures of modernity and foreign intervention.  There is evidence to show that The Story of Hong Gildong was a popular work at the time of its publication, but its rise as a kind of national epic did not occur until the modern era, through countless retellings in film, television, novels, and comic books.  In that sense, the Hong Gildong story that most Koreans are familiar with is largely a modern reinvention of the classic character, oftentimes serving specific political and cultural functions of the contemporary period.  This chapter examines the transformation of the figure from classic literature to its iconic status in the modern Korean imagination."
